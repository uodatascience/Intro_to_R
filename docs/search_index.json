You can do that at this link: https://www.r-project.org/ Second, you’ll want to download R studio. You can use R without R studio, but you probably don’t want to. R studio is an integrated development environment (IDE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). R studio can be downloaded at the following link: https://www.rstudio.com/ Okay, that is all you need to start your gloRious adventuRe. 2.2 How do I R?! 2.2.1 Using RStudio There are four main panels in the RStudio window. The top right panel is the workspace. Here you will find a list of all objects currently in memory. The bottom right window displays files in your working directory, plot output, available packages, and help documentation. The bottom left panel is the console. You can type code directly into the console and hit enter to execute it. The top left panel is the code editor. This is where you will write most of your code. In the code editor, you can write multiple lines of code and run chunks or the full script. The toolbar at the top of the panel allows you to interact with the code in the editor in some important ways. Hover your mouse pointer over the icons to see what each button does. There are also shortcuts that allow you to use the toolbar functions without ever taking your fingers from the keyboard. Here are some of the most commonly used: Function Keys Run highlighted code Cmd+Enter Insert &lt;- option+- (Un)comment lines Cmd+Shift+C Knit document Cmd+Shift+K Run from start to current line Cmd+Option+B Keyboard shortcut quick reference Option+Shift+K Another important shortcut is Tab to autocomplete functions or file names. For a more complete list, check out the RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet. Find it online by going to Help&gt;Cheatsheets&gt;RStudio IDE Cheatsheet, or by clicking the following URL https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf 2.3 Getting help For help with functions, in the console use the ? or ?? before a function name (e.g. ?functionName or ??functionName). The single ? will search for a function of that name whereas ?? will use your input as a keyword to search in all R documentation. RStudio’s Help. With RStudio open, click on Help in the RStudio toolbar to access some great built in resources. Under help, you’ll find a bunch of useful stuff. Some of the highlights are: +RStudio Docs, which will take you to RStudio’s online documentation page where you can likely find answers to many of your questions. Cheatseets. An easy way to access the highly recommended online cheatsheets for: The RStudio IDE dplyr and tidyr ggplot2 R Markdown Shiny devtools Keyboard Shortcuts help Markdown Quick Reference Ask a question on the UO Data Science Club Slack. All you need to join is a UO email address. Browse the golden nuggets left behind on the old website from when we were the UO R Club. &lt;- good stuff there. Check out the r-project site for more on help documentation. Search for answers to your questions on Stack Overflow. It’s likely someone has already asked and answered your question, and if not, you can post it and have a helpful stranger help you in likely very few minutes.If you do ask a question, make sure it’s a good one!

["what-is-r.html", "3 What is R? 3.1 Objects 3.2 Functions 3.3 Packages 3.4 Some useful basic syntax", " 3 What is R? R is a programming language designed for statistical computing. So, it is (in many ways) more similar to another programming language (e.g., Python) than it is to statistical software you may have experience with (e.g., SPSS). If you have no experience with programming languages and have only ever used statistical software (e.g., SPSS) for your stats then you will probably feel overwhelmed and confused by R for a little while. That’s fine and normal. Speaking for myself, I think I installed and opened R studio about a half dozen times over the course of a year before I ever used it becuase I had no idea where to get started. Hopefully this (and the next few weeks of the Data Science Club) helps you with that. How do we use R. Lots of ways! For starters, it’s like a calculator. Sort of like the graphing calculators that you may have been fascinated by at 16 (or at least I was for some reason). Because it’s like a calculator, we can use it like one. 5+6 ## [1] 11 Okay, but now we all have calculators in our phones, so this isn’t that cool. What else can R do? Lots of stuff. Almost all of it revolves around assigning and then later calling and manipulating objects. What is an object? It’s just R’s way of representing information. And then we can use that information later. 3.1 Objects How do we get R to represent some information as an object? We tell it to, using the assignment operator ‘&lt;-’. Whatever we put on the left side of the arrow becomes the name of the object and whatever is on the right side of the arrow becomes the definition of that object. For example, we may want to store what we had done earlier into an object. spinal_tap_amps &lt;- 5 + 6 Now, we can tell R to do something with this object. For example, we could get its sqaure root: sqrt(spinal_tap_amps) ## [1] 3.316625 Or we could use it in a logical statement if (spinal_tap_amps == 11) { print(&quot;But these go up to 11&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;But these go up to 11&quot; # And we could do this with other objects: other_amps &lt;- 10 if (other_amps == 11) { print(&quot;But these go up to 11&quot;) } I know the above had some new stuff in it (like wtf is with the curly brackets), but it’s just to demonstrate that we can do more with objects than just math. We now have 2 different objects: spinal_tap_amps and other_amps. We can put these together into an object called amps. We’ll do this like so: amp_volumes &lt;- c(spinal_tap_amps, other_amps) amp_volumes ## [1] 11 10 What happens if we take the sqrt of our new object? sqrt(amp_volumes) ## [1] 3.316625 3.162278 Would you look at that! It gave us the square roots of each of the values in our new object. How did it know? It knows because when we took two single-element objects and put them together, R recognized this new object as a vector. When we tell R to perform an operation on a vector, it will tend to perform that operation on each element. This will not always be the case, as certain functions will tell R to do something else, but it is generally the case. Now I know what you’re thinking. I don’t work with vectors I work with datasets! Just like we combined individual elements into a vector, we can combine vectors into a dataset. Since we’ve been working with the volume capacity of guitar amps (in case this hasn’t been obvious, this has all been a reference to spinal tap; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_Tap_(band)), let’s make a vector for the names of the bands we’re considering. Bands &lt;- c(&quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;Everyone Else&quot;) Now let’s put that and our vector of numbers together amp_volume_dataset &lt;- cbind(amp_volumes, Bands) And voila! We have a very simple dataset. Notice in the environment, R studio knows that this new object is data rather than values (values includes single objects/elements and vectors). R has a few different formats for data. We’ll likely talk more about these in later weeks as they become relevant. But check this out anyway: amp_volume_dataset &lt;- as.data.frame(amp_volume_dataset) See, now it’s a data frame. We could also change it to a data table (with as.table()) or other formats. The above illustrates another thing about r. If you use the same name for a new object, it will overwrite the old object. Now we can’t get our old unformatted data object. We will have to make it again if we want to: amp_volume_dataset &lt;- cbind(amp_volumes, Bands) And if we wanted both, we can just assign the dataframe to a new object amp_volume_dataframe &lt;- as.data.frame(amp_volume_dataset) 3.2 Functions c() is a function for putting things together it stands for concatenate(mneumonic: it also shares an initial with combine) it takes objects as the input, combines them, and provides the combined object as an output sqrt() is a function it takes numeric objects as inputs (elements, vectors, matrices), calculates square-root of each, and outputs the calculated square root. as.data.frame() is a function it takes some object and formats it as a dataframe print() is a function it takes some object as input, and the output is that object printed to the console cbind() is a fucntion it takes at least two objects, and combines them column-wise this is a good example of arguments separated by a comma. If you glance back to the cbind() function we used, we passed it two vectors, separated by a comma. cbind() expects you to provide two objects that you want to combine column-wise; these two objects are the first two arguments of cbind, and we separate them with a comma. Some of the functions that you’ll use are already in your install of R. You can write your own functions (more on this later on) or you can use one’s others have written, like sqrt(). Say we are confused about how a function works. We can google it (and you should) and we can also use R’s built in help. To access the help file of a function, you enter a ‘?’ followed by the package name: ?sqrt The help documentation can be pretty confusing if you aren’t quite familiar with the package/function. The examples (which are typically at the bottom) can be very helpful, even for beginners. And some are simpler than others: This one basically just says it computes square root of x, where x is a vector or array. It also tells you (subtly) what the function works with; square root expects a numerical vector (including a vector of 1, or an element). If we give it a vector of non-number objects (like the Bands list above), it won’t work. Sometimes checking the help documentation can tell you if you’ve given the function the wrong type of object. 3.3 Packages Often times, functions are part of packages or libraries in R. These are usually made by other people and have lots of functions you might find useful. One that we will start using soon is called the tidy verse. It’s actually a set of packages that the authors put together (you can also get each of the packages separately, butyou don’t need to). To use a new package, you’ll first need to install it. Let’s install the tidyverse: #install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) We just used the install.packages() function. This goes to cran, and downloads the package into our user library (which is where we store all of the packages we install). It requires you to enter the package name in quotes, like we did above. How does install.packages() know where to download the package from, and where does it go? Check its documentation with ?install.packages. In the list of arguments we see lib and repos = getOption(&quot;repos&quot;). Further down we see that lib defaults to the first element of .libPaths(). What do we get when we run those commands? getOption(&quot;repos&quot;) ## CRAN ## &quot;@CRAN@&quot; .libPaths() ## [1] &quot;/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library&quot; Most packages we use will come from cran, and if you ever need to modify or find package files for any reason, there they shall be. Now we have the package tidyverse, and can use it whenever we want. I’m so excited that I’m going touse one of the packages within the tidyverse called ggplot to make a simple plot of our spinal tap influenced dataset!!!!! ggplot(data=amp_volume_dataframe, aes(x=Bands, y = amp_volumes))+ geom_col() OMG, it didn’t work!!! Why?!?! I guess I’ll have to go back to my unsatisfying life in SPSS. Wait, its no big deal, we just forgot one simple step. In order to use a package, we have to call the library, or tell R that we’re going to be using this library (we’re basically telling it to keep it in its working memory). We load libraries into our environment with the library() function. We don’t need to put quotes (ie. make it a string) around the name in the library function (side note: you will make the mistake of quoting things in library and not quoting things in install.packages upwards of 100 times). This puts the library in the list of packages to search. For example, compare the output of search() before and after loading a library: search() ## [1] &quot;.GlobalEnv&quot; &quot;package:stats&quot; &quot;package:graphics&quot; ## [4] &quot;package:grDevices&quot; &quot;package:utils&quot; &quot;package:datasets&quot; ## [7] &quot;Autoloads&quot; &quot;package:base&quot; library(tidyverse) ## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2 ## Loading tidyverse: tibble ## Loading tidyverse: tidyr ## Loading tidyverse: readr ## Loading tidyverse: purrr ## Loading tidyverse: dplyr ## Conflicts with tidy packages ---------------------------------------------- ## filter(): dplyr, stats ## lag(): dplyr, stats search() ## [1] &quot;.GlobalEnv&quot; &quot;package:dplyr&quot; &quot;package:purrr&quot; ## [4] &quot;package:readr&quot; &quot;package:tidyr&quot; &quot;package:tibble&quot; ## [7] &quot;package:ggplot2&quot; &quot;package:tidyverse&quot; &quot;package:stats&quot; ## [10] &quot;package:graphics&quot; &quot;package:grDevices&quot; &quot;package:utils&quot; ## [13] &quot;package:datasets&quot; &quot;Autoloads&quot; &quot;package:base&quot; Importantly, you have to call all of the libraries you will use each time you start a new session in R. You may want to get in the habit of putting a bunch of library calls at the top of your script. library(tidyverse) And now let’s try to use ggplot ggplot(data=amp_volume_dataframe, aes(x=Bands, y = amp_volumes))+ geom_col() It worked! We’ll spend some time talking about ggplot (led by Jonny) a little later on, so don’t worry about what that code means. Soon you’ll know. What happens when two packages have functions with the same name? for example, both dplyr and plyr have functions named “summarise” that behave slightly differently. We can solve these “namespace conflicts” by being specific about where we load the library in our search paths. If we want to load the functions from plyr, but keep all our existing references to dplyr, we could do something like this (although if you’ve already loaded tidyverse, this won’t do anything because these packages are loaded by tidyverse) library(plyr, pos=100) # We can put it at an arbitrarily high number, it will be after everything but the base functions ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## You have loaded plyr after dplyr - this is likely to cause problems. ## If you need functions from both plyr and dplyr, please load plyr first, then dplyr: ## library(plyr); library(dplyr) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## ## Attaching package: &#39;plyr&#39; ## The following objects are masked _by_ &#39;package:dplyr&#39;: ## ## arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise, ## summarize ## The following object is masked _by_ &#39;package:purrr&#39;: ## ## compact library(dplyr) Or, we could make our code more explicit. We can directly reference a package’s functions without loading the library by using ::, for example with ggplot2::ggplot(data=amp_volume_dataframe, ggplot2::aes(x=Bands, y = amp_volumes))+ ggplot2::geom_col() 3.4 Some useful basic syntax We’ve covered some of the basics of R syntax (e.g., the assignment operator ‘&lt;-’) Here are a few more aspects of R syntax that are helpful to keep in mind R is case sensitive. So a and A would be two different objects A very common syntax mistake is using the wrong case (e.g., you assigned an object to a, and try to call it with A) A ‘#’ in R used for commenting. Once you place a ‘#’, everything on that lines that follows will be ignored by R. There are two main uses for this: Putting comments into your code to explain it to people reading it (including your future self) Removing code you don’t want to run but want to keep in the script for record keeping’s sake. R is newline terminated, meaning that things on the same line are considered a single statement. However, if a statement is incomplete (e.g., ends in an open parenthesis, or ends with a comma), R will search on the next line for the resolution. See the example below # Create 2 example vectors example_part1 &lt;- runif(100) example_part2 &lt;- runif(100) # All three of these are equivalent: example &lt;- cbind(example_part1, example_part2) example &lt;- cbind(example_part1, example_part2) example &lt;- cbind(example_part1 ,example_part2) You can typically subset objects using []. If the object is a matrix (i.e., has rows and columns), the argument order is [rows, columns]. If the object is a vector, then only one number goes in the bracket [rows]. Here are some examples of subsetting the example object from above example[1:50,] This would give us the first 50 rows, and all columns example[1:50, 1] This would give us the first 50 rows and just the first column example[,1] This would give us all rows, just the first column If you are using logical statements, you use “==” for is equal to. So, if we wanted to see if any elements in example is equal to 1, we would use the following: example == 1 This would provide us with an object the same dimensions as example, with TRUE or FALSE in every cell, where TRUE means the value in the cell was equal to 1 and FALSE means the value in the cell was not equal to 1. One reason for this is that ‘=’ can be used as an assignment operator (it is equivalent to ‘&lt;-’) and is also used in defining arguments in functions (e.g., instead of sqrt(example) we could write sqrt(x=example) because the first argument in sqrt is called x, so we can use an ‘=’ to define it). Some other logical statements: “==” means is equal to (from above) “!=” means not equal to “&gt;” means greater than “&lt;” means less than “&lt;=” means less than or equal to “&gt;=” means greater than or equal to That is all for this basic overview of R. Hopefully it has started to make youR adventuRe moRe toleRable! "],
["objects-1.html", "4 Objects 4.1 What are Objects? 4.2 Objects in R 4.3 Base Types 4.4 S3 Objects 4.5 S4 Objects 4.6 Reference Classes 4.7 References", " 4 Objects 4.1 What are Objects? Objects are, roughly, data (or more generally a stored state) that knows what it can do. We know what happens when we put this troublesome + guy between numbers 1 + 1 # ud better b sitting down ## [1] 2 But it’s less clear what it means to + letters &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; ## Error in &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;: non-numeric argument to binary operator Let’s see what typeof variables 1 and &quot;a&quot; are : typeof(1) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(&quot;a&quot;) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; (note this is a little misleading, typeof determines the base object class that an R object is stored as. All R objects are composed of base objects, we’ll get to the types of objects in the next section) R has a useful package pryr for inspecting objects and other meta-linguistic needs. Let’s get that now. # install.packages(&quot;pryr&quot;) 4.1.1 Object terminology A class is the description, or ‘blueprint’ of how individual objects or instances are made, including their attributes - which data should be kept and what it should be named, and methods, the functions that they are capable of calling on their stored data or attributes. Objects can have a nested structure, and sub-classes can inherit the attributes and methods of their parent classes. For example: As a class, trucks have attributes like engine_size, number_of_wheels, or number_of_jumps_gone_off. Trucks have the method go_faster(), but only individual instances of trucks can go_faster() - the concept/class of trucks can’t. As a subclass, monster_trucks also have the attributes engine_size, etc. and the method go_faster(), but they also have additional attributes like mythical_backstory and methods like monster_jam(). 4.2 Objects in R “In R functions are objects and can be manipulated in much the same way as any other object.” - R language guide 2.1.5 “S3 objects are functions that call the functions of their objects” - Also R 4.2.1 Object Systems R has base types and three object-oriented systems (also called types). We’ll spend more time on Base types and S3 objects in this lesson, and return to S4 and reference classes when we start building bigger code. Base types: Low-level C types. Build the other object systems. S3 - “Casual objects”: Objects that use generic functions. S3 methods “belong to” functions, not classes. Functions contain the UseMethod(“function_name”, object) function (see ?UseMethod). S4 - “Formal objects”: Formal classes with inheritance and means by which methods can be shared between classes. S4 methods still “belong to” functions, but classes are more rigorously defined. Reference classes: Objects that use message passing - or the method finally ‘belongs to’ the class rather than a function. The easiest way to see everything about an object is to use the str() function, short for structure. For example we can see everything about the lamest linear model ever lame_model &lt;- lm(c(1,2,3) ~ c(4,5,6)) str(lame_model) ## List of 12 ## $ coefficients : Named num [1:2] -3 1 ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;(Intercept)&quot; &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## $ residuals : Named num [1:3] -9.06e-17 1.81e-16 -9.06e-17 ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:3] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## $ effects : Named num [1:3] -3.46 -1.41 -2.22e-16 ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:3] &quot;(Intercept)&quot; &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; &quot;&quot; ## $ rank : int 2 ## $ fitted.values: Named num [1:3] 1 2 3 ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:3] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## $ assign : int [1:2] 0 1 ## $ qr :List of 5 ## ..$ qr : num [1:3, 1:2] -1.732 0.577 0.577 -8.66 -1.414 ... ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. .. ..$ : chr [1:3] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] &quot;(Intercept)&quot; &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;assign&quot;)= int [1:2] 0 1 ## ..$ qraux: num [1:2] 1.58 1.26 ## ..$ pivot: int [1:2] 1 2 ## ..$ tol : num 1e-07 ## ..$ rank : int 2 ## ..- attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;qr&quot; ## $ df.residual : int 1 ## $ xlevels : Named list() ## $ call : language lm(formula = c(1, 2, 3) ~ c(4, 5, 6)) ## $ terms :Classes &#39;terms&#39;, &#39;formula&#39; language c(1, 2, 3) ~ c(4, 5, 6) ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;variables&quot;)= language list(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6)) ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;factors&quot;)= int [1:2, 1] 0 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] &quot;c(1, 2, 3)&quot; &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## .. .. .. ..$ : chr &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;term.labels&quot;)= chr &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;order&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;intercept&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;response&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;.Environment&quot;)=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;predvars&quot;)= language list(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6)) ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dataClasses&quot;)= Named chr [1:2] &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;numeric&quot; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;c(1, 2, 3)&quot; &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## $ model :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 3 obs. of 2 variables: ## ..$ c(1, 2, 3): num [1:3] 1 2 3 ## ..$ c(4, 5, 6): num [1:3] 4 5 6 ## ..- attr(*, &quot;terms&quot;)=Classes &#39;terms&#39;, &#39;formula&#39; language c(1, 2, 3) ~ c(4, 5, 6) ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;variables&quot;)= language list(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6)) ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;factors&quot;)= int [1:2, 1] 0 1 ## .. .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] &quot;c(1, 2, 3)&quot; &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## .. .. .. .. ..$ : chr &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;term.labels&quot;)= chr &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;order&quot;)= int 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;intercept&quot;)= int 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;response&quot;)= int 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;.Environment&quot;)=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;predvars&quot;)= language list(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6)) ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dataClasses&quot;)= Named chr [1:2] &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;numeric&quot; ## .. .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;c(1, 2, 3)&quot; &quot;c(4, 5, 6)&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;lm&quot; We can query any object’s base type with pryr’s otype pryr::otype(c(1,2,3,4,5)) # A vector is a base object ## [1] &quot;base&quot; pryr::otype(data.frame(x=c(1,2,3,4,5))) # A dataframe is an S3 object ## [1] &quot;S3&quot; pryr::otype(lame_model) # as is our lame model. ## [1] &quot;S3&quot; and its class with class class(c(1,2,3,4,5)) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(lame_model) ## [1] &quot;lm&quot; Confusingly, R’s object system means that a given object will have both a class and a type, for example: pryr::otype(c(1)) # The vector &quot;c(1)&quot; is a base type object ## [1] &quot;base&quot; class(c(1)) # whose class is &#39;numeric&#39; ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; 4.2.2 Attributes Object can also have arbitrarily many attributes. The most important and common are names - which give the object the ability to refer to its elements by name. for example: # We can construct named vectors like this named_vector &lt;- c(&quot;apples&quot;=1, &quot;bananas&quot;=2, &quot;cherries&quot; = 3) names(named_vector) ## [1] &quot;apples&quot; &quot;bananas&quot; &quot;cherries&quot; named_vector[&quot;apples&quot;] ## apples ## 1 # or this named_vector &lt;- c(1,2,3) names(named_vector) &lt;- c(&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;cherries&quot;) class - which is used by the S3 object system, we’ll see that in a moment dim - short for dimensions, which is used by multidimensional base objects. We’ll see that in a moment too. You can query a specific attribute with attr attr(named_vector, &quot;names&quot;) ## [1] &quot;apples&quot; &quot;bananas&quot; &quot;cherries&quot; or list all attributes with attributes attributes(named_vector) ## $names ## [1] &quot;apples&quot; &quot;bananas&quot; &quot;cherries&quot; 4.3 Base Types Every R object is built out of basic C structures that define how it is stored and managed in memory. This table from Advanced R summarizes them: Homogenous data Heterogenous data 1-Dimensional Atomic Vector List 2-Dimensional Matrix Data frame N-Dimensional Array Recall that we can use typeof() to find an object’s base type typeof(1) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(list(1,2,3)) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; 4.3.1 Vectors Vectors are sequences, the most basic data type in R. They have two varieties: atomic vectors (with homogenous values) and lists (with … heterogenous values). R has no 0-dimensional, scalar types, so individual characters or numbers are length=one atomic vectors. They are: Atomic Vector Type Example Logical booleans &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA) Integer integers &lt;- c(1L, 2L, 3L) Double (== numeric) doubles &lt;- c(1, 2.5, 0.005) Character characters &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;) raw and complex types also exist, but they are rare. Vectors are constructed with c(). When heterogeneous vectors are constructed with c(), they are coerced to the most permissive vector type (an integer can be both a double (floating point numbers with decimal points) and character “1”) - the table above is ordered from least to most permissive. vect_1 &lt;- c(1L, 2L, 3L) vect_2 &lt;- c(1L, 2L, 3) vect_3 &lt;- c(1L,2,&quot;3&quot;) typeof(vect_1) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; typeof(vect_2) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(vect_3) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; # We select elements of vectors with [] notation vect_1[1] ## [1] 1 vect_3[1] ## [1] &quot;1&quot; Each of the different atomic vector types has different methods (we’ll come back to how methods work in a bit), which explains why we can 1 + 1 but not &quot;1&quot; + &quot;1&quot;. Notice how the integer class has a set of methods called “Arith” (see ?Arith, an S4 group of generic functions, something we won’t talk about until section 5) but character doesn’t. methods(class=&quot;integer&quot;) ## [1] as.data.frame ## see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code methods(class=&quot;character&quot;) ## [1] all.equal as.data.frame ## [3] as.Date as.POSIXlt ## [5] as.raster formula ## [7] getDLLRegisteredRoutines ## see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code To make a vector that preserves the types of its elements, make a list instead a_list &lt;- list(1L,2,&quot;3&quot;) a_list ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;3&quot; typeof(a_list[[1]]) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; typeof(a_list[[2]]) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(a_list[[3]]) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; Notice the double bracket notation [[]]. Lists are commonly recursive, ie. they store other lists. Since the elements of our list are themselves lists, single bracket indexing [] returns lists, and [[]] returns the the elements in that list. is.recursive(a_list) ## [1] TRUE a_list[1] ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 typeof(a_list[1]) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; # Indexing recursive lists b_list &lt;- list(1:3, c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cucumber&quot;)) b_list ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;apple&quot; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;cucumber&quot; b_list[1] # gets the first list ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 b_list[1][1] # doesn&#39;t work ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 b_list[[1]] # gets the contents of the first list ## [1] 1 2 3 b_list[[1]][1] # gets the first element of the contents of the first list ## [1] 1 Similarly to coersion among atomic vectors, vectors that contain lists will be coerced to lists. c(1,2,3) ## [1] 1 2 3 c(c(1),c(2,3)) # vectors can&#39;t be recursive, so they get flattened ## [1] 1 2 3 c(c(1),list(2,3)) # if one element is a list, the whole object will become a list ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 2 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 3 list(c(1,2,3), c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 2 3 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; # Unlist turns lists back into (flat) atomic vectors unlist(list(c(1,2,3), c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;))) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; Because they are the most general form of vector, lists are used as the base type for many derived classes, like data frames typeof(data.frame(c(1,2,3))) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; 4.3.2 Matrices &amp; Arrays Arrays are atomic vectors with a dim attribute.

Functions, environments, and other stuff that we’ll learn about in our section on Functions are also base objects, but we’ll discuss them then. 4.4 S3 Objects S3 objects “belong to” functions, which become their methods. S3 classes don’t really “exist,” but are assigned as an object’s “class” attribute. S3 classes are one of the worst things about R, but are also responsible for some of its flexibility. x &lt;- 1 attr(x, &quot;class&quot;) ## NULL class(x) &lt;- &quot;letters&quot; attr(x, &quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;letters&quot; One can find an articulation of the reasoning behind this “function-and-class” programming can be found here: https://developer.r-project.org/howMethodsWork.pdf. We’ll talk more about this in later sections. S3 objects are defined by a series of functions that themselves contain the UseMethod() function - this is described briefly above, try ?UseMethod for more detail. These functions extend the generic function, typically using the syntax generic.class() as in the case of mean.Date() for taking the mean of dates. One can list the objects that have a generic method, and the methods that an object has with methods() methods(mean) # list the classes that have this method ## [1] mean.Date mean.default mean.difftime mean.POSIXct mean.POSIXlt ## see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code methods(class=&quot;Date&quot;) # list the methods that this class has ## [1] - [ [[ [&lt;- + ## [6] as.character as.data.frame as.list as.POSIXct as.POSIXlt ## [11] Axis c cut diff format ## [16] hist is.numeric julian Math mean ## [21] months Ops pretty print quarters ## [26] rep round seq split str ## [31] summary Summary trunc weekdays weighted.mean ## [36] xtfrm ## see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code By default, the source code of S3 methods is not visible to R, one can retreive it with `utils::getS3method`` The plot base function is an s3 generic method. pryr::ftype(plot) # get a function&#39;s type ## [1] &quot;s3&quot; &quot;generic&quot; By default, if the first argument is a base type compatible with being points on a scatterplot, the actual function that is called is plot.default, whose source behaves like you’d expect: plot.default ## function (x, y = NULL, type = &quot;p&quot;, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, ## log = &quot;&quot;, main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, ## ann = par(&quot;ann&quot;), axes = TRUE, frame.plot = axes, panel.first = NULL, ## panel.last = NULL, asp = NA, ...) ## { ## localAxis &lt;- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) Axis(...) ## localBox &lt;- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) box(...) ## localWindow &lt;- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) plot.window(...) ## localTitle &lt;- function(..., col, bg, pch, cex, lty, lwd) title(...) ## xlabel &lt;- if (!missing(x)) ## deparse(substitute(x)) ## ylabel &lt;- if (!missing(y)) ## deparse(substitute(y)) ## xy &lt;- xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) ## xlab &lt;- if (is.null(xlab)) ## xy$xlab ## else xlab ## ylab &lt;- if (is.null(ylab)) ## xy$ylab ## else ylab ## xlim &lt;- if (is.null(xlim)) ## range(xy$x[is.finite(xy$x)]) ## else xlim ## ylim &lt;- if (is.null(ylim)) ## range(xy$y[is.finite(xy$y)]) ## else ylim ## dev.hold() ## on.exit(dev.flush()) ## plot.new() ## localWindow(xlim, ylim, log, asp, ...) ## panel.first ## plot.xy(xy, type, ...) ## panel.last ## if (axes) { ## localAxis(if (is.null(y)) ## xy$x ## else x, side = 1, ...) ## localAxis(if (is.null(y)) ## x ## else y, side = 2, ...) ## } ## if (frame.plot) ## localBox(...) ## if (ann) ## localTitle(main = main, sub = sub, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, ## ...) ## invisible() ## } ## &lt;bytecode: 0x7fdf04c4ba28&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:graphics&gt; If the first argument to plot has its own plot method (ie. that it is exported by the object’s package namespace, more about this in section 5), that function is called instead. That’s why aq &lt;- datasets::airquality plot(lm(Ozone ~ Month, data=aq)) is different than this nonsensical model plot(lme4::lmer(Ozone ~ 0 + (Day | Month), data=aq)) 4.4.1 Example: Extending S3 Objects http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html “Creating new methods and generics” Using a class’s method is what allows us to do sensible computations on different types of objects with the same command. pryr::ftype(mean) # mean is an s3 generic function ## [1] &quot;s3&quot; &quot;generic&quot; x &lt;- 1 class(x) &lt;- &quot;just_one&quot; # We give our &quot;just_one&quot; class a mean method: mean.just_one &lt;- function(x, ...) print(&quot;that&#39;s just a one you maniac&quot;) # Mean behaves like it should for numbers and lists of numbers mean(1) ## [1] 1 mean(c(1,1.5)) ## [1] 1.25 mean(x) # Even though &quot;x&quot; is just 1, because we have given it a &quot;class&quot; attribute it calls mean.just_one rather than mean.default ## [1] &quot;that&#39;s just a one you maniac&quot; # Other objects have their own mean() method methods(mean) ## [1] mean,ANY-method mean,Matrix-method ## [3] mean,sparseMatrix-method mean,sparseVector-method ## [5] mean.Date mean.default ## [7] mean.difftime mean.just_one ## [9] mean.POSIXct mean.POSIXlt ## see &#39;?methods&#39; for accessing help and source code # like Date objects dates &lt;- c(&quot;01jan2000&quot;,&quot;15jan2000&quot;) attr(dates,&quot;class&quot;) ## NULL mean(dates) # Don&#39;t work ## Warning in mean.default(dates): argument is not numeric or logical: ## returning NA ## [1] NA # turn it into &quot;Date&quot; object dates &lt;- as.Date(dates, &quot;%d%b%Y&quot;) # base has a set of &quot;as&quot; methods to convert types attr(dates,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Date&quot; mean(dates) # will call its method ## [1] &quot;2000-01-08&quot; mean.Date(dates) # which can also be called directly ## [1] &quot;2000-01-08&quot; 4.5 S4 Objects S4 objects have a single class definition with specifically defined fields and functions. They are too complicated for us to cover in much detail yet, so we will return to them again later. We could pretend for awhile we’re another class with S3 objects a &lt;- data.frame(a=&quot;test&quot;) class(a) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; class(a) &lt;- &quot;lm&quot; a ## ## Call: ## NULL ## ## No coefficients summary(a) ## Error in if (p == 0) {: argument is of length zero Not so with S4 objects. We can finally implement our truck classes setClass(&quot;truck&quot;, slots = list(engine_size = &quot;numeric&quot;, n_wheels = &quot;numeric&quot;, n_jumps = &quot;numeric&quot;)) setClass(&quot;monster_truck&quot;, slots = list(mythical_backstory = &quot;character&quot;), contains = &quot;truck&quot;) getClass(&quot;monster_truck&quot;) S4 objects have slots, accessible with @ (which behaves like $) or slot(). We create new instances of S4 objects with new() my_truck &lt;- new(&quot;truck&quot;, engine_size = 4, n_wheels = 4, n_jumps = 40) my_truck@engine_size slot(my_truck, &quot;n_jumps&quot;) S4 Methods are a headache (and we will skip them in the class). One has to create a generic function if it does not yet exist with setGeneric(), then set the method, classes and function separately with setMethod(). An example for your edification: setGeneric(&quot;go_faster&quot;, function(which_truck, how_fast) {standardGeneric(&quot;go_faster&quot;)}) setMethod(&quot;go_faster&quot;, signature = c(which_truck = &quot;truck&quot;, how_fast = &quot;character&quot;), function(which_truck, how_fast){ print(&quot;your truck is now going:&quot;) print(how_fast) print(&quot;in MPH:&quot;) print(which_truck@engine_size * 4) } ) go_faster(my_truck, &quot;2 fast 4 u 2 c&quot;) Try extending that to have the monster trucks tell their mythical_backstory as they accelerate. We will return to S4 objects in more detail in section 5. 4.6 Reference Classes References classes are a “truly” object oriented system in R, but we are going to skip them entirely for now because they are rare enough that you aren’t likely to encounter them yet.

["data.html", "5 Data 5.1 Loading 5.2 Saving 5.3 Indexing 5.4 Piping Syntax 5.5 Reshaping 5.6 Summarizing 5.7 Resources", " 5 Data 5.1 Loading 5.1.1 One day we will have a summary table here Most of the time we have a datafile (either on our hard drive or on the internet) that we want to work with in R. To do that, we can use a function to read the data into R. For instance, the read.table() is a flexible function for reading in data in various formats. 5.1.2 .csv files In order to use read.table(), you will typically need to specify some of the arguments, such as the argument sep =, which is where you specify the thing that seperates values in your data file. For example, if you are working with a data file in the comma seperated values (csv) format, you would need to specify that commas are the seperator with sep = &quot;,&quot;. 5.1.3 Defaults Thankfully, other people have done this for us, and have created functions that have the proper defaults to work with common formats like csv fles. For csv files, To see the defaults, simply check the documentation with e.g. ?read.table read.csv() is basically a version of read.table() with the defaults set up to work well with csv files. These defaults include setting “,” as the seperator, and setting header = TRUE, which means that R will read in the first row in the csv file as being a header row, and treat that row as the row of column names. These defaults can be changed though, so if you had a file with no header, you would indicate that with header = FALSE, like so read.csv(file_path/file_name.csv, header = FALSE) where file_path is the full path to the file, and file_name is the name of the data file. Take a look at the documentation for read.csv() with ?read.csv() to see the different arguments and defaults. 5.1.4 A brief interlude into formats for data in R There are lots of options for reading data into R, even for a single format. For example, we could instead use read_csv() from the readr package. The main difference between read.csv() and read_csv() is that they load the data into different formats in R. read.csv() will read your data in as a data.frame, which is a common format of data in R. read_csv() will read your data in as a tibble, which is the data format associated with the tidyverse. There are a couple of differences between these formats. They have different printing defaults, there are differences in subsetting, and differences in recycling. Check out the documentation by running the code vignette(&quot;tibble&quot;) or by checking out the chapter on tibbles in the R for Data Science Book http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html. Outside of these differences, they are mostly interchangeable (for most purposes), but occassionally a function will only work properly with one or the other. For example, the reshape() function only works properly with data.frames (unless that has changed in an update). 5.1.5 Format issues? In some rare cases, you may be getting an error due to differences between how your data is formatted in R and what format the function you’re attempting to use works with. This will sometimes be spelled out in the documentation (e.g., reshape says it takes data frames as the first argument), but its not always clear; sometimes, you just need to test it out. If you do need to go between different formats, that is easy to do in R with a couple of functions. as.data.frame() will turn an object that can be a dataframe into a dataframe. as_tibble will turn an object that can be a tibble into a tibble. 5.1.6 .sav files R can also work with datafiles that are formatted for SPSS, which have the extension ‘.sav’. Like csv’s, there are a few options. The one that seems to work the best is read_spss() from the haven package (also a part of the tidyverse). There is also a function called read.spss() from the foreign package, but it is no longer being maintained and may stop working; it also had some frustrating qualities, so probably best to stick to read_spss(). It’s worth noting that read_spss() will format your data as a tibble. If you don’t want it as a tibble, you can always use the as.data.frame() function to turn it into a generic data.frame. 5.1.7 rio for general import Another function worth knowing about for reading in data is the import() function from the rio package. The nice thing about import() is that it works with lots of different types of datafiles, and very little has to be changed for each type of datafile. For example, if our data (let’s say its name is ‘df’) were a .sav file, we would read it in with the following command: import(df.sav) If it were instead a csv, we would use the following command: import(df.csv) Note that virtually nothing changed, just the file extension (which is part of the name of the file). import() is able to figure out the format of the file based on that extension. Remember to assign your data to a variable in the environment! A pretty common and frustrating mistake people make when starting with R is not saving their data file as an object. For example, if we were loading in our datafile called ‘df’, we may want to run some code like this: import(df.csv) However, this is telling R to just read the data. If you run code like that, it will simply read the data, and print out the data (or some subset of it) into the console. Then, when you go to work with the data, it won’t be in your global environment. That’s because you didn’t save it as an object. You would do that the same way you save anything as an object, with the assignment operator: &lt;-. So instead of the above, you’d instead want to run something like the following: df &lt;- import(df.csv) Now R has read our data and stored it as an object called df, that we can start running our models on. 5.2 Saving Most of the above functions have complementary write functions, for example write.csv or haven::write_sav. There are two other common ways you may want to save your data 5.2.1 .RData files Because all objects in R descend from a precious few C structures, they can all be easily serialized, or converted into a string of bits that can be written to disk (not always true in other languages, like Python). These files typically can’t be read by anything but R (except if that thing is another programming language where someone has written a specific routine to do so!), so if your mom tries to look at your cool data in openoffice they’ll be out of luck. Saving (and loading) .RData files works with the … save and … load functions cant_forget &lt;- c(&quot;you have to stop wiping your nose with just whatever is close at hand&quot;, &quot;see you did it just now that was mine&quot;) save(cant_forget, file=&quot;cant_forget.RData&quot;) # Now delete the object so we know our load is real rm(cant_forget) # here we load to the .GlobalEnv, don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll cover environments later load(&quot;cant_forget.RData&quot;) cant_forget ## [1] &quot;you have to stop wiping your nose with just whatever is close at hand&quot; ## [2] &quot;see you did it just now that was mine&quot; Note: as is true of all files, the extension (ending it with ‘RData’) doesn’t effect the way that a file is saved or represented on the disk, it just serves to tell the operating system which programs can open it, and to tell other programs how they should open it. You could just as easily save your object like save(cant_forget, file=&quot;cant_forget.butiwantto&quot;) There is one special .RData file, and that’s the file that’s just called “.RData” in your user directory (for osx /Users/Username – probably hidden by default). R automatically loads this file every time it opens – this is the file that is made whenever you accept RStudio’s frequent offers to save your workspace image. save is also capable of using a few common compression algorithms. This is most useful for large objects that have many repeated values – common with “long” format data. save(cant_forget, file=&quot;cant_forget.RData&quot;, compress=TRUE, # or &quot;gzip&quot;, &quot;bzip2&quot;, &quot;xz&quot; compression_level=6) # more is smaller, but slower If you’re curious, check out the saveRDS function - it’s designed to save single objects (rather than save, which can save arbitrary numbers of objects by keeping them in an environment). Since save saves the object and its environment, when it is loaded it will have the same name – this can be troublesome when you have already used that name, or when you forget what the name is. Loading objects (readRDS) saved by saveRDS works like other loading functions, so you can assign the loaded object to whatver name you’d like. saveRDS(cant_forget, file=&quot;cant_forget.rds&quot;) # We can rewrite our fate. sad_news &lt;- readRDS(&quot;cant_forget.rds&quot;) 5.2.2 sink Perhaps common is an overstatement. Consider these the option of last resort when all you want to do is put what you see in this window in some other window and ya don’t care how ya do it. Any output that would go to the console (specifically to stdout - try ?stdout - so it’s a bit tricky to open a sink in a code chunk) can be diverted to a file by using the sink function. You must call sink with a filename to start diverting data, and then call sink again to stop. # Open the sink sink(&quot;save-everything-here.txt&quot;) life_story &lt;- c(&quot;what we need at the store 2day guys&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s always just apples and bananas&quot;, &quot;we have severe vitamin deficiencies&quot;) life_story ## [1] &quot;what we need at the store 2day guys&quot; ## [2] &quot;it&#39;s always just apples and bananas&quot; ## [3] &quot;we have severe vitamin deficiencies&quot; # turn off the sink sink() # now see what&#39;s in our file readLines(&quot;save-everything-here.txt&quot;) ## character(0) sink doesn’t work with graphical output, to do that we have to use a function that dumps to a graphics driver, which then saves it as a file. We can see our current graphics device by getting that option… getOption(&quot;device&quot;) ## function (width = 7, height = 7, ...) ## { ## grDevices::pdf(NULL, width, height, ...) ## } ## &lt;environment: namespace:knitr&gt; The devices available in the base package are: pdf() postscript() xfig() bitmap() pictex() For example # make n save a cool plot to show your friends pdf(&quot;put-plots-here.pdf&quot;) plot(seq(1,5)) dev.off() ## quartz_off_screen ## 2 # open the pdf however yer system wants to abs_path &lt;- file.path(getwd(), &quot;put-plots-here.pdf&quot;) system2(&#39;open&#39;, args=abs_path, wait=FALSE) Notice how we have to use dev.off() rather than calling pdf() again as would be expected from sink 5.3 Indexing Or, how to get specific pieces of stuff. We’ve already seen a bunch of basic indexing # try ?seq x &lt;- seq(5, 25, 5) x ## [1] 5 10 15 20 25 y &lt;- array(1:24, dim=c(3,8)) y ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ## [1,] 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 ## [2,] 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 ## [3,] 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 z &lt;- list(&quot;scores&quot;=c(1,2,3,4,5), &quot;numbers&quot;=c(6,7,8,9,10)) # good ole positional indexing x[3] ## [1] 15 # indexing with a vector to select multiple positions x[c(3,5)] ## [1] 15 25 # higher dimensional objects have more dimensions to index y[1,5] ## [1] 13 # both together y[3, c(3,4,7)] ## [1] 9 12 21 # leaving a position blank selects all of its indices y[2,] ## [1] 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 # with names names(x) &lt;- c(&quot;adam&quot;, &quot;steve&quot;, &quot;harry&quot;, &quot;ted&quot;, &quot;watson&quot;) x[&quot;harry&quot;] ## harry ## 15 z[&quot;numbers&quot;] ## $numbers ## [1] 6 7 8 9 10 # Using double brackets to return a vector instead of a list z[[&quot;numbers&quot;]] ## [1] 6 7 8 9 10 # and the equivalent dollar sign z$scores ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 Negative values deselect x[-3] ## adam steve ted watson ## 5 10 20 25 # useful to select starting from the end -(1:3) # quick way to construct sequences of negative numbers ## [1] -1 -2 -3 x[-(1:3)] # get the last two ## ted watson ## 20 25 We have also seen chained indexing, think of it like indexing the product of each successive indexing operation x[c(1,3,5)][2] ## harry ## 15 z[[&quot;numbers&quot;]][4] ## [1] 9 # one reason why it&#39;s important what class is returned from your indexing operation # aka knowing why we use double brackets z[&quot;numbers&quot;][4] ## $&lt;NA&gt; ## NULL dplyr has a select function and a collection of tools (“select helpers”) to make selecting variables by name a bit more flexible: starts_with() ends_with() contains() matches() - variables that match a regular expression num_range() - eg num_range(&quot;x&quot;,1:5) to select x1, x2, ... one_of() - find variables in a list, eg. one_of(c(&quot;calcium&quot;, &quot;potassium&quot;, &quot;magnesium&quot;)) everything() - all variables, don’t know why you’d use this.

If you give something too small, it will be repeated Rather than having to create a new object, we can assign to an indexed subset of an object friends &lt;- data.frame(names=c(&quot;toothbrush&quot;, &quot;vacuum&quot;, &quot;blinds&quot;), hobbies=c(&quot;brushing&quot;, &quot;spinning&quot;, &quot;darkening&quot;), favorites=c(1,2,3)) # too small :( friends$favorites &lt;- c(4,5) ## Error in `$&lt;-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, favorites, value = c(4, 5)): replacement has 2 rows, data has 3 # toothbrush and vacuum get a demotion friends[c(1,2),]$favorites &lt;- c(4,5) 5.4 Piping Syntax Before we get into reshaping data, its importantt we cover a type of syntax called piping. Piping is not unique to R, but it is highly useful in R, especially for data wrangling and manipulation. The pipe itself is this symbol %&gt;%, and in R, it comes from the magrittr package (this is a references to the famous painging by Magritte,the treachery of images). magrittr is part of the tidyverse, so it will load when you call the tidyverse library. 5.4.0.1 A quick sidenote about the term pipe As mentioned above, a pipe in piping syntax is symbolized by %&gt;%. However, another character is sometimes called a pipe, which is the vertical bar |, and this is used quite a bit in logical/boolean operations (| means or in logical statements). 5.4.0.2 The logic of piping syntax The general idea of piping syntax, is that we have some function on the lefthand and righthand side of the pipe. The function on the leftside is evaluated, and then the output of that function is passed to the function on the righthand side of the pipe as the first argument of that function. Let’s start with a simple example. We’ll create a vector of values and take the mean. # first set.seed, because we&#39;re going to be sampling values. # this will make it so we always get the same result. set.seed(100) # first create a vector using rnorm. This is saying give me a random sample of 20 observations, drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and sd of 1. rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1) %&gt;% mean() ## [1] 5.107867 As you can see, on the lefthand side of the pipe %&gt;%, we have a function that create a vector of 20 values (sampled from a normal distribution, with a mean of 5 and an sd of 1). On the righthand side, we simply have the function mean(), which calculates the mean of a vector of values. And so what’s happening, is first the function on the righthand side creates a vector; the output of this function is simply the vector of values: set.seed(100) rnorm(n=20, mean = 5, sd = 1) ## [1] 4.497808 5.131531 4.921083 5.886785 5.116971 5.318630 4.418209 ## [8] 5.714533 4.174741 4.640138 5.089886 5.096274 4.798366 5.739840 ## [15] 5.123380 4.970683 4.611146 5.510856 4.086186 7.310297 So the output of this fucntion, the vector of 20 values, is then passed along to the mean function. The mean function requires a vector of values for its first argument (see for yourself by running ?mean). So, we end the pipe with simply mean(), and this provides the mean. 5.4.0.3 A quick tip about style It’s typically considered good practice to not have more than one pipe per line. So what I have above is considered bad coding style. So instead of set.seed(100) rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1) %&gt;% mean() ## [1] 5.107867 You should instead do this: set.seed(100) rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1) %&gt;% mean() ## [1] 5.107867 5.4.0.4 Logic of Piping Syntax continued As we covered above, the function following the pipe takes the output of the preceding function as its first argument. In the preceding example, we didn’t supply another argument, and so the righthand side of the pipe was simply mean(). Let’s say, we wanted to specify an additional argument. One option in mean() is trim, which indicates the proportion of values we want to trim from the vector before calculating the mean. Let’s say we wanted only half the data points; I have no idea why someone would do something like this, especially with a vector of 20 values, but let’s do it anyway. set.seed(100) # This is the same as before rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1) %&gt;% # Notice that the mean() function now contains the argument trim = 0.5 mean(trim = 0.5) ## [1] 5.09308 You’ll see we got a slightly different value; a value a little closer to the population mean of 5, since 50% of the values in the tails were removed from the vectore before calculating the mean. This can be pretty confusing when you’re new to piping, because our mean() function is basically missing an argument, namely, the argument with the name of the vector of values. Importantly, the argument isn’t missing, it’s just sort of hidden under the hood. The mean() line above, to R, is actually looking something like this: mean(vector_output_above, trim = 0.5), it’s just that the first argument is hidden from view. We could do this in two steps, without pipes. set.seed(100) # we could create the vectore, and save it as an object vector_from_pipe &lt;- rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1) # and then take the mean mean(vector_from_pipe, trim = .5) ## [1] 5.09308 And we get the same trimmed mean. We could also do this with one step: set.seed(100) mean(rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1), trim = .5) ## [1] 5.09308 And we can see that we get the same result. Some of you may have noticed that we have three different routes to the same destination. So why use pipes? 5.4.1 Why use pipes? There are probably lots of reasons to use or not use pipes. The most important and most often mentioned reasons to use pipes are cleanliness (which I hear is next to godliness) and efficiency. We can think of three related advantages: Cleaner code This is nice, because it helps make your code more readable by other humans. Other humans include your future self, who may return to a code file 6 months or a year later, and want to know wtf the code is doing. Cleaner environment When you use pipes, you have basically no reason to save objects from intermediary steps in your data wrangling / analysis workflow, because you can just pass output from function to function without saving it (recall when we broke apart the pipe into two steps above). Efficiency This is efficiency for you, the person doing the coding (not more efficient computing) This advantage primarily comes from the fact that withhout pipes, you have to save objects from intermediary steps. This can create ineffencies and/or errors: Inefficiences stem from having to keep coming up with names for objects from intermediary steps. errors can crop up from re-using names (to be more efficient), which can easily lead to calling the wrong object in an analysis or over-writing one that you need later. 5.4.1.1 Cleaner code With pipes, its often easier to make code that is cleaner, and easier for other humans to read. The last part is important, because R doesnt care if your code is clean (as long as its syntactically correct), but clean code is easier for your collaborators (including future you) to understand. Why do pipes make cleaner code? An example may help with this. Compare this: set.seed(100) mean(rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1), trim = .5) to this: set.seed(100) rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1) %&gt;% mean(trim = 0.5) The second, piped, example is a little easier to parse. One reason is it more closely matches the way we tend to think about analysis. In the former example, we’re saying take a mean, and what I want you to take a mean of is this vector, and this is how I want you to make this vector (random sample from a normal dist, etc.). In the latter, we’re saying make a vector like this (random sample, etc.), and then take its mean. I find the latter is more similar to the way I think about the steps in an analysis. 5.4.1.2 A cleaner environment This is a smaller and less important advantage, but an advantage none the less. Not having to save objects from intermediary steps means less stuff crowding up you environment. Now, you don’t have to save those intermediary steps, but doing so will often make cleaner code. Pipes maximize cleanliness of both your code and environment, so with pipes you don’t have to make this trade-off. Recall this example: set.seed(100) # we could create the vectore, and save it as an object vector_from_pipe &lt;- rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1) # and then take the mean mean(vector_from_pipe, trim = .5) We saved the vector me made with rnorm() so that we could pass that vector to the mean function. Now this code is a little easier to read than this code, that doesn’t save the object: mean(rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1), trim = .5) So the first chunk is easier to read, but clutters our environment, while the second chunk is harder to read but creates less clutter. Which is better? Who know. Pipes avoid making this tough decision, by making cleaner code that doesn’t clutter up our environment: rnorm(n = 20, mean = 5, sd = 1) %&gt;% mean() You may be wondering why a cluttered environment matters. The main thing is that it can create ineffeciencies in two ways: 1. sometimes you want to quickly glance over to your environment window to get some information (like what you named that dataset); this is obviously harder in a busier visual environment. 2. You can hit tab to autocomplete; the more objects with similar names you have, the less efficient autocomplete is. 5.4.1.3 Efficiency This one is pretty straight forward. By not having to save objects from intermediary steps, we have to come up with less names and remember less names. Coming up with names is hard; remembering what names correspond to what is harder. Both of these things will slow you down. For example, we had to name the vector when we saved it in the above example; this added about 2 seconds to my work in preparing this code. Say we needed a new vector, that was the log transformed values of the previous vetor. We might name that log_vector_from_pipe; this probably added another 2 seconds. Now obviously, these are small additions of time, but they add up. Plus, sometimes coming up with unique names gets tough (when you’re on the 5th or 6th or 10th vector that you have to name) 5.4.1.4 A note about Scaling One more thing to keep in mind is that gains in cleanliness and efficiency scale with the complexity of what you’re doing. Let’s say, we had a dataset that we wanted to take a subset of cases/rows from (those where age is &gt; 25), and just a couple of just a couple of columns (a, b, c, d), then we wanted to log transform that data, and then wanted to get descriptives for all of the remaining variables. Without pipes, you’ll either end up with some difficult to read code: library(psych) describe(log(select(filter(data, age &gt; 5), a, b, c, d))) or some throwaway objects: library (psych) data_subset_age &lt;- filter(data, age &gt; 5) data_subset_age_abcd &lt;- select(data_subset_age, a, b, c, d) log_data_subset_age_abcd &lt;- log(data_subset_age_abcd) describe(log_data_subset_age_abcd) With pipes, we can avoid these issues: data %&gt;% filter(age &gt; 25) %&gt;% select(a, b, c, d) %&gt;% describe() See, so much easier to read, and not flooding our enviornment with clutter and not taxing our already taxed minds with having to come up with a bunch of damn names. 5.4.2 Saving the output of your pipe So far, we’ve been runing with example where we just ran functions in pipes without saving the output. Sometimes this is useful, like if we just wanted to see the descriptives in the above example (and didn’t want to do anything else with those descriptives). But, often we want to take the output from the pipe and save it to an object so we can do analyses with it later. For example, instead of just getting descriptives, maybe we want a dataset that has only people above 25 and columns a, b, c, d to use in analyses. We just add the assignment and object name at the top, like so: age25plus_abcd &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(age &gt; 25) %&gt;% select(a, b, c, d) 5.5 Reshaping At the start of the data manipulation section, we talked about long vs wide data. Now let’s talk about how to actually lengthen or widen or data. We’ll use the same dataset we made up for the starting example: 4 year longitudinal study where the Big Five were measured annually. 5.5.1 Wide vs. Long Data Let’s start by talking about one of the more common data format issues, which is whether data are structured in a long or wide format. These, like basically all things, exist on a continuum (data is almost always somewhere in between the extremes of long and wide). So, it’s probably helpful to start with an example. One common design that leads to data easily represented as wide or long is longitudinal data. Let’s say we administer the Big Five Inventory - 2 (BFI-2; Soto &amp; John, 2016) to a sample of incoming freshman annually for 4 years. To keep things simple, let’s say we only have that data (nothing else was administered). In this case, you may have a dataset that looks like this: ## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2 ## Loading tidyverse: tibble ## Loading tidyverse: tidyr ## Loading tidyverse: readr ## Loading tidyverse: purrr ## Conflicts with tidy packages ---------------------------------------------- ## filter(): dplyr, stats ## lag(): dplyr, stats ## # A tibble: 100 x 21 ## pid agreeableness_t1 conscientiousness_t1 neuroticism_t1 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 2.561910 2.226287 1.482124 ## 2 2 3.764061 3.424002 2.976117 ## 3 3 3.261961 2.416053 3.026659 ## 4 4 3.773405 3.415036 3.163681 ## 5 5 2.185621 1.454738 3.410008 ## 6 6 2.561549 2.481250 2.372637 ## 7 7 2.279778 2.720208 3.636918 ## 8 8 3.230945 4.007457 1.798065 ## 9 9 1.842271 2.530430 4.346542 ## 10 10 3.247076 3.297897 2.401233 ## # ... with 90 more rows, and 17 more variables: extraversion_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # openness_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, agreeableness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # neuroticism_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # agreeableness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # neuroticism_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # agreeableness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # neuroticism_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt; ## Classes &#39;tbl_df&#39;, &#39;tbl&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 100 obs. of 21 variables: ## $ pid : num 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ agreeableness_t1 : num 2.56 3.76 3.26 3.77 2.19 ... ## $ conscientiousness_t1: num 2.23 3.42 2.42 3.42 1.45 ... ## $ neuroticism_t1 : num 1.48 2.98 3.03 3.16 3.41 ... ## $ extraversion_t1 : num 1.78 3.89 3.25 2.93 3.2 ... ## $ openness_t1 : num 3.28 3.82 2.57 3.57 3.18 ... ## $ agreeableness_t2 : num 3.13 4.38 3.58 4.62 3 ... ## $ conscientiousness_t2: num 3.05 3.89 2.84 4.35 1.93 ... ## $ neuroticism_t2 : num 2.46 3.62 3.35 3.82 4.17 ... ## $ extraversion_t2 : num 2.33 4.72 3.95 3.36 3.67 ... ## $ openness_t2 : num 3.77 4.14 2.88 4.32 4.04 ... ## $ agreeableness_t3 : num 3.64 4.89 4.19 5.1 3.39 ... ## $ conscientiousness_t3: num 3.35 4.09 3.64 5.14 2.63 ... ## $ neuroticism_t3 : num 3.37 4.16 3.91 4.42 4.97 ... ## $ extraversion_t3 : num 2.67 4.96 4.4 4.05 4.04 ... ## $ openness_t3 : num 4.28 4.63 3.48 4.92 4.29 ... ## $ agreeableness_t4 : num 4.21 5.49 4.75 5.44 3.44 ... ## $ conscientiousness_t4: num 3.79 4.55 3.9 5.94 3.35 ... ## $ neuroticism_t4 : num 3.52 4.55 4.1 4.67 5.34 ... ## $ extraversion_t4 : num 3.49 5.43 4.99 4.78 4.5 ... ## $ openness_t4 : num 4.87 5.22 3.98 5.54 4.91 ... As you can see in the above, we have a row for each participant, and a column corresponding to each Big 5 score at each time point. For example, column 2 contains each participant’s score on Agreeableness at time 1, column 7 contains each participant’s score on Agreeableness at time 2, etc. This data is in a wide format. It’s also in basically the widest format it could be in for any reasonable purpose; the only way to make it wider would be to have a single row, and a column for each participant X Big 5 score X time point. What would make this data long? There are two dimensions that we could lengthen the data on, but the more common one you might see is time. That is, we’d have a row for each participant X time point combination, like the following: So we now have a row for each participant at each time point, and a column for each of the Big 5. We could also make it a little longer, by making each row correspond to a score on each Big Five trait for each participant at each time point, like so: sample_b5_data_long %&gt;% gather(trait, score, agreeableness:openness) ## # A tibble: 2,000 x 4 ## pid time trait score ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 t1 agreeableness 2.561910 ## 2 1 t2 agreeableness 3.129489 ## 3 1 t3 agreeableness 3.637314 ## 4 1 t4 agreeableness 4.207066 ## 5 2 t1 agreeableness 3.764061 ## 6 2 t2 agreeableness 4.377288 ## 7 2 t3 agreeableness 4.889805 ## 8 2 t4 agreeableness 5.487121 ## 9 3 t1 agreeableness 3.261961 ## 10 3 t2 agreeableness 3.575117 ## # ... with 1,990 more rows 5.5.2 Wide to Long We’ll start with lengthening our data. We currently have our data in a wide format that looks something like this for now: sample_b5_data_wide ## # A tibble: 100 x 21 ## pid agreeableness_t1 conscientiousness_t1 neuroticism_t1 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 2.561910 2.226287 1.482124 ## 2 2 3.764061 3.424002 2.976117 ## 3 3 3.261961 2.416053 3.026659 ## 4 4 3.773405 3.415036 3.163681 ## 5 5 2.185621 1.454738 3.410008 ## 6 6 2.561549 2.481250 2.372637 ## 7 7 2.279778 2.720208 3.636918 ## 8 8 3.230945 4.007457 1.798065 ## 9 9 1.842271 2.530430 4.346542 ## 10 10 3.247076 3.297897 2.401233 ## # ... with 90 more rows, and 17 more variables: extraversion_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # openness_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, agreeableness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # neuroticism_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # agreeableness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # neuroticism_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # agreeableness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # neuroticism_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt; And say we want it to lengthen it to look like this: ## # A tibble: 400 x 7 ## pid time agreeableness conscientiousness extraversion neuroticism ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 t1 2.561910 2.226287 1.777716 1.482124 ## 2 1 t2 3.129489 3.054222 2.330667 2.459631 ## 3 1 t3 3.637314 3.350964 2.672625 3.374978 ## 4 1 t4 4.207066 3.790548 3.487093 3.517931 ## 5 2 t1 3.764061 3.424002 3.891194 2.976117 ## 6 2 t2 4.377288 3.888895 4.719864 3.623774 ## 7 2 t3 4.889805 4.092564 4.958199 4.163255 ## 8 2 t4 5.487121 4.545136 5.434412 4.552172 ## 9 3 t1 3.261961 2.416053 3.253923 3.026659 ## 10 3 t2 3.575117 2.843559 3.951325 3.346487 ## # ... with 390 more rows, and 1 more variables: openness &lt;dbl&gt; We can use a function called gather() from the tidyr package (another package in the tidyverse). gather() requires at least three arguments: data This one is easy. It is the dataset that we want to lengthen key This is the name for the new variable (or new column) that will contain the information that was previously in the column names. In most cases, it will be the name for the new variable that contains the name for what used to be variables. In our example, this column will contain the variables agreeableness_t1, conscientiousness_t1, etc. You can give any name you want here. value this is the name of the new variable (or new column) that will contain the scores that used to be spread out across different columns. And that’s all that is required. The most important remaining part of this syntax is the columns that you want to gather, or the variables that you want to become key-value pairs. Another way to put this is which columns do you want to become rows (lengthening the data)? If you don’t name any columns, it will select all of them. The syntax for this part works similarly to select(). You can name a series of variables, like agreeableness_t1:openness_t4 , or name each column individually separated by a comma agreeabeleness_t1, conscientiousness, ..., openness_t4, or you can say which columns you do not want with a minus sign in front of the column name. Since we want to include all of our columns except participant id (pid), we’ll use the minus sign to tell gather() include everything but pid sample_b5_data_wide %&gt;% gather(variable, score, -pid) ## # A tibble: 2,000 x 3 ## pid variable score ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 agreeableness_t1 2.561910 ## 2 2 agreeableness_t1 3.764061 ## 3 3 agreeableness_t1 3.261961 ## 4 4 agreeableness_t1 3.773405 ## 5 5 agreeableness_t1 2.185621 ## 6 6 agreeableness_t1 2.561549 ## 7 7 agreeableness_t1 2.279778 ## 8 8 agreeableness_t1 3.230945 ## 9 9 agreeableness_t1 1.842271 ## 10 10 agreeableness_t1 3.247076 ## # ... with 1,990 more rows Okay, so this brings us to our first issue when trying to lengthen a dataset. The key column (what we called variable) contains the trait that was measured and the time point. That is, this column contains 2 pieces of information that we probably want kept separately. We want these to be in separate columns, so that we can select certain traits or time points, or model slopes across time points. Thankfully, the authors of tidyr anticipated this problem, and created a useful function called separate(), which basically takes data within a single column, and splits it into multiple columns. Let’s add that into the pipeline on the variable column. We’re going to throw a pipe on the end of gather into separate. This will put the dataset above as the first argument in the separate function. We then tell it the columns we want to separate (variable in this case) and provide it the names of the new columns, which we’ll call trait and time, for Big Five trait and time point. sample_b5_data_wide %&gt;% gather(variable, score, -pid) %&gt;% separate(variable, c(&quot;trait&quot;, &quot;time&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 2,000 x 4 ## pid trait time score ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 agreeableness t1 2.561910 ## 2 2 agreeableness t1 3.764061 ## 3 3 agreeableness t1 3.261961 ## 4 4 agreeableness t1 3.773405 ## 5 5 agreeableness t1 2.185621 ## 6 6 agreeableness t1 2.561549 ## 7 7 agreeableness t1 2.279778 ## 8 8 agreeableness t1 3.230945 ## 9 9 agreeableness t1 1.842271 ## 10 10 agreeableness t1 3.247076 ## # ... with 1,990 more rows You’ll notice we didn’t tell separate anything other than the column we wanted separated (variable) and the name of two new columns (trait and time). How did it know how to separate that column? Well, basically, separate looks for something called regular expressions. We’ll get into more detail about regular expressions later on, but one regular expression is the underscore for separating things. So it recognized that every string in the variable column contained a underscore. Then, it put the character string on the left hand side of the underscore into the first column name we gave it (trait) and put the character string on the right hand side of the underscore into the second column name we gave it (time). If we wanted to be more explicit, we could specify the sep= argument like so: # We&#39;re going to save this to an object called sample_b5_data_long sample_b5_data_long&lt;- sample_b5_data_wide %&gt;% gather(variable, score, -pid) %&gt;% separate(variable, c(&quot;trait&quot;, &quot;time&quot;), sep = &quot;_&quot;) sample_b5_data_long ## # A tibble: 2,000 x 4 ## pid trait time score ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 agreeableness t1 2.561910 ## 2 2 agreeableness t1 3.764061 ## 3 3 agreeableness t1 3.261961 ## 4 4 agreeableness t1 3.773405 ## 5 5 agreeableness t1 2.185621 ## 6 6 agreeableness t1 2.561549 ## 7 7 agreeableness t1 2.279778 ## 8 8 agreeableness t1 3.230945 ## 9 9 agreeableness t1 1.842271 ## 10 10 agreeableness t1 3.247076 ## # ... with 1,990 more rows See, that did the same thing. Now, let’s save this long data, and see what we have to do to get it wide again. 5.5.3 Long to wide I will say, that my one mild frustration with tidyr(), with all due respect, is that it seems to be optimized to getting data into long format. I take it, from reading R for Data Science &lt;r4ds.had.co.nz&gt; , that Hadley Wickham and company prefer long data (my sense is that they consider data tidy when its in its longest format, though perhaps I misread). Long data is great and all, but sometimes we need wide data. Specifically, we need wide data for SEM and Path Analysis, which we use pretty regularly in psychology. All of that said, you can use spread() from tidyr to widen your data. There is also the reshape() function from base R, which I sometimes find makes widening data a little easier than spread(). Let’s go over each in turn. 5.5.3.1 Spread Spread is part of the tidyr() package, and is the function from that package for reshaping data from long to wide format. It’s syntactically pretty similar to spread() making it pretty easy to go between the two, which is nice. Spread requires 3 arguments, which you’ll see mirror gather: Data The data that you want to widen key The column that contains the values that you want to be columns. This would be either the variable or time column from our above example dataset. value The column that contains the values you want to fill the cells beneath the new columns with. This would be the score column from above. Let’s say we’re starting with our data in a long format like the one above, and we wanted to get it to a wide format, like the one we started with (where each row was a participant, and each column was a trait at a particular time, like agreeableness_t1). We might start with this sample_b5_data_long2 &lt;- sample_b5_data_long %&gt;% spread(trait, score) sample_b5_data_long2 ## # A tibble: 400 x 7 ## pid time agreeableness conscientiousness extraversion neuroticism ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 t1 2.561910 2.226287 1.777716 1.482124 ## 2 1 t2 3.129489 3.054222 2.330667 2.459631 ## 3 1 t3 3.637314 3.350964 2.672625 3.374978 ## 4 1 t4 4.207066 3.790548 3.487093 3.517931 ## 5 2 t1 3.764061 3.424002 3.891194 2.976117 ## 6 2 t2 4.377288 3.888895 4.719864 3.623774 ## 7 2 t3 4.889805 4.092564 4.958199 4.163255 ## 8 2 t4 5.487121 4.545136 5.434412 4.552172 ## 9 3 t1 3.261961 2.416053 3.253923 3.026659 ## 10 3 t2 3.575117 2.843559 3.951325 3.346487 ## # ... with 390 more rows, and 1 more variables: openness &lt;dbl&gt; Okay, that got us about halfway there. We now have a separate column for each trait, but time is still row-wise. Maybe we could try spreading time, but what would be the value column? We currently have 5. Let’s try passing it all of them. sample_b5_data_long %&gt;% spread(time, score) %&gt;% spread(trait, agreeableness:openness) # note that if you pass it a vector of names like c(&quot;agreeableness&quot;, etc.) it also won&#39;t work We can’t do that; we can only give exactly one column for the value argument in spread. Herein lies my frustration with spread. Now there is a workaround. If you’re data is in the longer format from above (where each row was a participant X trait X time combo), then you can first use unite() (the complement to separate). unite() requires an argument for data and the column name you want it to add (once it unites the columns you tell it to unite). You’ll probably also want to name specific columns, which can be done just like other tidyr functions, by listing their unquoted names (or if you have a range of columns, you can use column_name_at_start_of_range:column_name_at_end_of_range). So, we’ll add in a unite before we get to spread, and see if that fixes it: sample_b5_data_long %&gt;% unite(variable, trait, time) %&gt;% spread(variable, score) ## # A tibble: 100 x 21 ## pid agreeableness_t1 agreeableness_t2 agreeableness_t3 ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 2.561910 3.129489 3.637314 ## 2 2 3.764061 4.377288 4.889805 ## 3 3 3.261961 3.575117 4.186379 ## 4 4 3.773405 4.618759 5.095310 ## 5 5 2.185621 3.003284 3.388888 ## 6 6 2.561549 2.854060 3.408756 ## 7 7 2.279778 2.853680 3.186240 ## 8 8 3.230945 3.818676 4.285996 ## 9 9 1.842271 2.166671 2.772455 ## 10 10 3.247076 3.899260 4.298564 ## # ... with 90 more rows, and 17 more variables: agreeableness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # conscientiousness_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # conscientiousness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # extraversion_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # extraversion_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # neuroticism_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # openness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt; Okay, that got our data into the right format. So, spread isn’t that bad, but you typically need to start with data in (just about) the longest format possible, and to use unite() function as well. But, sometimes our data are in between the longest format possible and the wide format that we want. Sometimes we get data like we accidentally got above, where each row is a participant X time point and each column is trait.

Well, if we want to use gather, we’ll have to first lengthen the data, and unite the columns that we need to unite, and then spread. So it will something like this: sample_b5_data_long2 %&gt;% # first gather (you&#39;ll have to remember to not gather pid AND time) gather(trait, score, -pid, -time) %&gt;% # Then unite trait and time into a column called variable unite(variable, trait, time) %&gt;% # then spread it spread(variable, score) ## # A tibble: 100 x 21 ## pid agreeableness_t1 agreeableness_t2 agreeableness_t3 ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 2.561910 3.129489 3.637314 ## 2 2 3.764061 4.377288 4.889805 ## 3 3 3.261961 3.575117 4.186379 ## 4 4 3.773405 4.618759 5.095310 ## 5 5 2.185621 3.003284 3.388888 ## 6 6 2.561549 2.854060 3.408756 ## 7 7 2.279778 2.853680 3.186240 ## 8 8 3.230945 3.818676 4.285996 ## 9 9 1.842271 2.166671 2.772455 ## 10 10 3.247076 3.899260 4.298564 ## # ... with 90 more rows, and 17 more variables: agreeableness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # conscientiousness_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # conscientiousness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # extraversion_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, extraversion_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # extraversion_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # neuroticism_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # openness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt; So that isn’t sooooo bad. But, it can be a little cumbersome, because you’re using several different functions together. So to do this right, you have to remember a pretty complex sequence (or look it up each time). Plus, when your data is more complicated than this data (which was intentionally made pretty simple), it becomes pretty easy to make a mistake in one of these steps (not remembering which columns not to gather in step 2 above, remembering to unite the right columns, etc.). So, reshape() from base R is sometimes a little easier in these cases. Let’s talk about that now. 5.5.3.2 Using reshape(): long to wide In general, reshape() is a little more complicated. It has more arguments, and more of the arguments are required. But, like I said, it is sometimes a little easier for widening data than spread(). One thing to keep in mind is, unlike spread() and gather(), reshape() is used for widening or lengthening data, and you have to specify the direction in the function. Let’s say our data look like the intermediate data we’ve used before. I mean this data shape: sample_b5_data_long2 ## # A tibble: 400 x 7 ## pid time agreeableness conscientiousness extraversion neuroticism ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 t1 2.561910 2.226287 1.777716 1.482124 ## 2 1 t2 3.129489 3.054222 2.330667 2.459631 ## 3 1 t3 3.637314 3.350964 2.672625 3.374978 ## 4 1 t4 4.207066 3.790548 3.487093 3.517931 ## 5 2 t1 3.764061 3.424002 3.891194 2.976117 ## 6 2 t2 4.377288 3.888895 4.719864 3.623774 ## 7 2 t3 4.889805 4.092564 4.958199 4.163255 ## 8 2 t4 5.487121 4.545136 5.434412 4.552172 ## 9 3 t1 3.261961 2.416053 3.253923 3.026659 ## 10 3 t2 3.575117 2.843559 3.951325 3.346487 ## # ... with 390 more rows, and 1 more variables: openness &lt;dbl&gt; And we wanted it to look like our dataset above, where each row is a unique participant. We could use reshape like so reshape(sample_b5_data_long2, # This one is straight forward; just the column with participant id&#39;s idvar = &quot;pid&quot;, # This won&#39;t always be time. timevar is the variable you want to move from rows into column names. # It&#39;s equivalen to key in the spread() function timevar = &quot;time&quot;, # Gotta tell it what direction to go. direction = &quot;wide&quot;, # Note, this is fully optional, but the defailt is &quot;.&quot;, and I wanted it to look like the above, with a &quot;_&quot; sep = &quot;_&quot;) ## # A tibble: 100 x 6 ## pid `agreeableness_c(&quot;t1&quot;, &quot;t2&quot;, &quot;t3&quot;, &quot;t4&quot;)` ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 NA ## 2 2 NA ## 3 3 NA ## 4 4 NA ## 5 5 NA ## 6 6 NA ## 7 7 NA ## 8 8 NA ## 9 9 NA ## 10 10 NA ## # ... with 90 more rows, and 4 more variables: `conscientiousness_c(&quot;t1&quot;, ## # &quot;t2&quot;, &quot;t3&quot;, &quot;t4&quot;)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `extraversion_c(&quot;t1&quot;, &quot;t2&quot;, &quot;t3&quot;, ## # &quot;t4&quot;)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `neuroticism_c(&quot;t1&quot;, &quot;t2&quot;, &quot;t3&quot;, &quot;t4&quot;)` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `openness_c(&quot;t1&quot;, &quot;t2&quot;, &quot;t3&quot;, &quot;t4&quot;)` &lt;dbl&gt; Holy sh**, what happened!?!?! What did I do This brings us to what has got to be the most common mistake made with reshape() in modern times (post tidyverse times, that is). The reason we got that hot mess above is beecause reshape only works with data.frames NOT tibbles. Now our data set sample_b5_data_long2 is probably a tibble. Let’s check that out with the structure function str() str(sample_b5_data_long2) ## Classes &#39;tbl_df&#39;, &#39;tbl&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 400 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ pid : num 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 ... ## $ time : chr &quot;t1&quot; &quot;t2&quot; &quot;t3&quot; &quot;t4&quot; ... ## $ agreeableness : num 2.56 3.13 3.64 4.21 3.76 ... ## $ conscientiousness: num 2.23 3.05 3.35 3.79 3.42 ... ## $ extraversion : num 1.78 2.33 2.67 3.49 3.89 ... ## $ neuroticism : num 1.48 2.46 3.37 3.52 2.98 ... ## $ openness : num 3.28 3.77 4.28 4.87 3.82 ... Yep, it looks like it’s class is tbl_df, tbl, and data.frame, which means its a tibble. Thankfully, this is an easy fix, you just need to turn the tibble into a data.frame with as.data.frame(). So let’s add that into the pipeline. sample_b5_data_long2 %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% # Note, because we&#39;re piping things, we start with &#39;idvar=&#39; instead of the name of the data reshape(idvar = &quot;pid&quot;, timevar = &quot;time&quot;, direction = &quot;wide&quot;, # Note, this is fully optional, but the defailt is &quot;.&quot;, and I wanted it to look like the above, with a &quot;_&quot; sep = &quot;_&quot;) %&gt;% # Turning it back into a tibble, because they print a little nicer as_tibble() ## # A tibble: 100 x 21 ## pid agreeableness_t1 conscientiousness_t1 extraversion_t1 ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 2.561910 2.226287 1.777716 ## 2 2 3.764061 3.424002 3.891194 ## 3 3 3.261961 2.416053 3.253923 ## 4 4 3.773405 3.415036 2.934184 ## 5 5 2.185621 1.454738 3.201466 ## 6 6 2.561549 2.481250 5.477701 ## 7 7 2.279778 2.720208 3.471753 ## 8 8 3.230945 4.007457 4.326198 ## 9 9 1.842271 2.530430 3.668598 ## 10 10 3.247076 3.297897 2.862606 ## # ... with 90 more rows, and 17 more variables: neuroticism_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # openness_t1 &lt;dbl&gt;, agreeableness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # extraversion_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t2 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # agreeableness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # extraversion_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # agreeableness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, conscientiousness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # extraversion_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, neuroticism_t4 &lt;dbl&gt;, openness_t4 &lt;dbl&gt; Whew, it worked! By learning this limitation of reshape(), you’re avoiding a very confusing rabbit hole that I spent almost a full week in! Side note: tidyverse functions will turn your data into tibbles, so be aware (the one exception is pipes; they don’t do that). 5.5.3.3 Using reshape(): wide to long Now, you can use reshape() to go from wide to long too. I’d recommend using gather() from tidyr for that instead, but for the sake of completeness, this is how it would work: sample_b5_data_wide %&gt;% #never forget to make it a data.frame! as.data.frame() %&gt;% # when going from wide to long, you have to tell it the varying variables. # These are the columns that contain the information you want in rows. # This is a little confusing, but basically, you give it a list, with vectors for each thing that shares that information. # So, all the t1 variables go into the same vector # then, all the t2 variables go into the same vector, etc. reshape(varying = c(c(&quot;agreeableness_t1&quot;, &quot;conscientiousness_t1&quot;, &quot;extraversion_t1&quot;, &quot;neuroticism_t1&quot;, &quot;openness_t1&quot;), c(&quot;agreeableness_t2&quot;, &quot;conscientiousness_t2&quot;, &quot;extraversion_t2&quot;, &quot;neuroticism_t2&quot;, &quot;openness_t2&quot;), c(&quot;agreeableness_t3&quot;, &quot;conscientiousness_t3&quot;, &quot;extraversion_t3&quot;, &quot;neuroticism_t3&quot;, &quot;openness_t3&quot;), c(&quot;agreeableness_t4&quot;, &quot;conscientiousness_t4&quot;, &quot;extraversion_t4&quot;, &quot;neuroticism_t4&quot;, &quot;openness_t4&quot;)), # sep is really important here, because it tells it where to split the columns sep = &quot;_&quot;, # and of course, tell it the direction direction = &quot;long&quot;) %&gt;% # Turning it back into a tibble, because they print a little nicer as_tibble() ## # A tibble: 400 x 8 ## pid time agreeableness conscientiousness extraversion neuroticism ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 t1 2.561910 2.226287 1.777716 1.482124 ## 2 2 t1 3.764061 3.424002 3.891194 2.976117 ## 3 3 t1 3.261961 2.416053 3.253923 3.026659 ## 4 4 t1 3.773405 3.415036 2.934184 3.163681 ## 5 5 t1 2.185621 1.454738 3.201466 3.410008 ## 6 6 t1 2.561549 2.481250 5.477701 2.372637 ## 7 7 t1 2.279778 2.720208 3.471753 3.636918 ## 8 8 t1 3.230945 4.007457 4.326198 1.798065 ## 9 9 t1 1.842271 2.530430 3.668598 4.346542 ## 10 10 t1 3.247076 3.297897 2.862606 2.401233 ## # ... with 390 more rows, and 2 more variables: openness &lt;dbl&gt;, id &lt;int&gt; There, that worked, but it was a little inefficient compared to gather() I think. 5.5.4 Final note on reshaping data So now you how to reshape your data. Some general tips to keep in mind: gather() is great for lengthening data; I would recommend it over reshape() everytime. separate() can be used to separate a column that really contains multiple pieces of information spread() works for getting widening your data, but it can require some in between steps. gather() can be used to combine information kept in two separate columns remember, this is a big one for getting data into wide format with tidyr and spread() reshape() works really well for widening your data; I recommend it over spread() in most cases. the exception being when your dataset is already in a long (and really, the longest reasonable) format. reshape() can be used to lengthen your data, but it’s syntax is a little wonky 5.6 Summarizing Typically, we are interested in some summary of our data rather than the individual values themselves. Summarization operations reduce a large number of observations to a single or few summarizing values. 5.6.1 Basic Summarization You’re familiar with many summarization operations (and their often obviously named base r implementations): Operation Function Mean/Average mean() Weighted Mean weighted.mean() Median median() Max/Min max() / min(), which.min() or .max() returns the index, rather than the value Variance var() Standard Deviation sd() A simple way to get a global summary of all variables in a dataframe is to use psych::describe df &lt;- ggplot2::diamonds pander::pander( psych::describe(df) ) Table continues below vars n mean sd median trimmed mad carat 1 53940 0.7979 0.474 0.7 0.735 0.4744 cut* 2 53940 3.904 1.117 4 4.042 1.483 color* 3 53940 3.594 1.701 4 3.553 1.483 clarity* 4 53940 4.051 1.647 4 3.914 1.483 depth 5 53940 61.75 1.433 61.8 61.78 1.038 table 6 53940 57.46 2.234 57 57.32 1.483 price 7 53940 3933 3989 2401 3159 2476 x 8 53940 5.731 1.122 5.7 5.66 1.379 y 9 53940 5.735 1.142 5.71 5.663 1.364 z 10 53940 3.539 0.7057 3.53 3.495 0.8451 min max range skew kurtosis se carat 0.2 5.01 4.81 1.117 1.256 0.002041 cut* 1 5 4 -0.7171 -0.3981 0.004808 color* 1 7 6 0.1894 -0.8669 0.007324 clarity* 1 8 7 0.5514 -0.3949 0.007092 depth 43 79 36 -0.08229 5.738 0.006168 table 43 95 52 0.7969 2.801 0.009621 price 326 18823 18497 1.618 2.177 17.18 x 0 10.74 10.74 0.3787 -0.6183 0.00483 y 0 58.9 58.9 2.434 91.2 0.004918 z 0 31.8 31.8 1.522 47.08 0.003039 We can also apply any function to a dataframe along a dimension. Typically functions that work on numerical data don’t work on factorial or character data, so one has to be mindful about your call making sense. For example, if we want to get the means of each of the numeric columns in our dataframe, we call apply on the 5th-9th columns of our dataframe (df[,5:9]), tell it to operate along the second dimension (columnwise), and apply mean: apply(df[,5:9], 2, mean) ## depth table price x y ## 61.749405 57.457184 3932.799722 5.731157 5.734526 Note that if we called it over the whole dataframe, mean will throw up warnings about being applied to non-numeric data, apply will quit after 10 warnings by default. apply(df, 2, mean) ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or ## logical: returning NA ## carat cut color clarity depth table price x y ## NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## z ## NA apply is the base function in several convenience/extension functions in base R, like sweep and aggregate, and functions similarly to lapply, tapply, mapply, rapply, eapply, etc. 5.6.2 Grouped Summarization If our data is in long format, the variable we are interested in summarizing is grouped by one or several others. For example, in our diamonds dataset we would expect price to be different depending on the diamond’s cut and carat. plyr handles grouping elegantly with its summarise (summarize is an alias for us Americans) function. summarize can be used in a pipe, but since I am a stodgy old grandpa I prefer to use it in conjunction with one of the plyr::*ply functions (ddply when the input is a dataframe and the output is a dataframe, ldply for input lists output dataframes, dlply for input dataframes and output lists, etc.). ddply works like apply, but by first splitting the data by grouping variables. When summarize is used with ddply, the arguments afterwards are passed to summarize, and with them we can make whatever new variables we want. # We use the .() syntax so we don&#39;t have to pass variable names as strings. # .(cut, carat) is the same as c(&quot;cut&quot;, &quot;carat&quot;) library(plyr) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## You have loaded plyr after dplyr - this is likely to cause problems. ## If you need functions from both plyr and dplyr, please load plyr first, then dplyr: ## library(plyr); library(dplyr) ## ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## ## Attaching package: &#39;plyr&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:purrr&#39;: ## ## compact ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:dplyr&#39;: ## ## arrange, count, desc, failwith, id, mutate, rename, summarise, ## summarize df_summary &lt;- ddply(df, .(cut, carat), summarise, mean_price = mean(price), sd_price = sd(price), n_samples = length(price)) pander::pander( head(df_summary) ) cut carat mean_price sd_price n_samples Fair 0.22 337 NA 1 Fair 0.23 369 NA 1 Fair 0.25 645.7 333.8 3 Fair 0.27 371 NA 1 Fair 0.29 1184 837.2 2 Fair 0.3 702.1 172.2 20 Whoa, that’s a lot of variables.

It is possible to get away with just knowing the top-level graphics packages, but understanding the full system is critical for making publication-quality figures. Without understanding grid, one cannot add custom labels or layouts to ggplot2 plots; without understanding graphics devices, it may be unclear why saving as a pdf allows one to edit individual plot elements in Illustrator while png does not. 6.2 Base graphics Base R graphics are made with a series of function calls, typically starting with a function that ‘creates’ the plot (like, say, plot()), and subsequent functions that modify that same plot. par() is used to set graphical parameters. Paul Murrell has compiled a mnemonic table to help remember the different parameters of par(). We won’t discuss base graphics in much detail, as I haven’t seen a situation where using ggplot2 isn’t a better idea.

To get started, the only thing your data needs to be is a) be, b) a dataframe, c) “long”, and d) properly classed. By properly classed I don’t mean it needs to be the diamonds dataset, I mean that each column in your dataframe should be explicitly cast as the datatype you intend it to be - as.factor() your factors and as.numeric() your numbers. But we are gonna use diamonds because we are properly classed. library(ggplot2) pander::pander( head(diamonds) ) carat cut color clarity depth table price x y z 0.23 Ideal E SI2 61.5 55 326 3.95 3.98 2.43 0.21 Premium E SI1 59.8 61 326 3.89 3.84 2.31 0.23 Good E VS1 56.9 65 327 4.05 4.07 2.31 0.29 Premium I VS2 62.4 58 334 4.2 4.23 2.63 0.31 Good J SI2 63.3 58 335 4.34 4.35 2.75 0.24 Very Good J VVS2 62.8 57 336 3.94 3.96 2.48 # But we don&#39;t want to plot 50000 points every time so diamond_sub &lt;- diamonds[sample(1:nrow(diamonds), 500, replace=FALSE),] 6.3.1 Layers What is a statistical graphic? The good ole boys Wilkinson and Wickham tell us that they are Mappings from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) Of geometric objects (points, lines bars) On a particular coordinate system Perhaps after a statistical transformation We’ll follow their lead. In ggplot, that combination of things forms a layer. The terminology in ggplot is aes - aesthetic mappings geom - geometric objects scale - …scales stat - statistical transformations Reordered, the flow of information in ggplot2 is: data is attached to the ggplot call, mapped by aes, and transformed by stat before being passed to a geom, which is placed, sized, and colored according to its relevant scales then ta-da! rendered plot. 6.3.2 (aes)thetic mappings Lets get ahead of ourselves and make a plot because we haven’t made one yet and our console is whining in the backseat. g &lt;- ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat, y=price))+ geom_point() g We made a ggplot object named “g” that is attached to the dataframe “diamond_sub” g &lt;- ggplot(diamond_sub, and has the aesthetic parameters “x” and “y” mapped to the columns “carat” and “price,” respectively aes(x=carat, y=price)). Then we added + another element to our plot, geom_point() which tells us that we want our aesthetic mapping represented geometrically as points. Note that we have to add parentheses to tell R that we want that function evaluated even if we don’t pass any arguments. We then rendered the plot by calling the variable name g. Each geom (or more precisely, each stat, but we’ll get to that in a bit) has a certain subset of aes’s that apply to it (don’t we all). You can list all aes’s with ggplot2:::.all_aesthetics ## [1] &quot;adj&quot; &quot;alpha&quot; &quot;angle&quot; &quot;bg&quot; &quot;cex&quot; ## [6] &quot;col&quot; &quot;color&quot; &quot;colour&quot; &quot;fg&quot; &quot;fill&quot; ## [11] &quot;group&quot; &quot;hjust&quot; &quot;label&quot; &quot;linetype&quot; &quot;lower&quot; ## [16] &quot;lty&quot; &quot;lwd&quot; &quot;max&quot; &quot;middle&quot; &quot;min&quot; ## [21] &quot;pch&quot; &quot;radius&quot; &quot;sample&quot; &quot;shape&quot; &quot;size&quot; ## [26] &quot;srt&quot; &quot;upper&quot; &quot;vjust&quot; &quot;weight&quot; &quot;width&quot; ## [31] &quot;x&quot; &quot;xend&quot; &quot;xmax&quot; &quot;xmin&quot; &quot;xintercept&quot; ## [36] &quot;y&quot; &quot;yend&quot; &quot;ymax&quot; &quot;ymin&quot; &quot;yintercept&quot; ## [41] &quot;z&quot; or by doing the same on the proto version of any geom, like ggplot2:::GeomPoint ## &lt;ggproto object: Class GeomPoint, Geom&gt; ## aesthetics: function ## default_aes: uneval ## draw_group: function ## draw_key: function ## draw_layer: function ## draw_panel: function ## extra_params: na.rm ## handle_na: function ## non_missing_aes: size shape colour ## optional_aes: ## parameters: function ## required_aes: x y ## setup_data: function ## use_defaults: function ## super: &lt;ggproto object: Class Geom&gt; Note the “required_aes” and “non_missing_aes” for required and optional aes, respectively. In general, you’ll always be able to map color (or colour, color is just an alias), x, and y. Commonly you’ll also be able to map fill for things that take up area. Aesthetics declared in the original call to ggplot, unless otherwise specified, apply to each added element. Within a given element, you can add, override, or remove aesthetics, like so: # Add coloring by ... color ... to the points ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat, y=price))+ geom_line()+ geom_point(aes(color=color)) You can make the same plot (except for order) in a worse way by specifying color in the base ggplot call and removing it with NULL from the lines. ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=color))+ geom_point()+ geom_line(aes(color=NULL)) Damn those are some ugly graphs, but this guide is about “can” not “should.” Notice how the order in which you add elements matters - the points are ‘on top of’ the lines in the first plot because the geom_point call came second, and vice-versa in the second plot. You can also perform operations within the aes(), say if you want to fatten out a ribbon without it being a big goofy line # The economics dataset with an added &#39;epoch&#39; factor to recolor every 100 points. economics_epoch &lt;- economics economics_epoch$epoch &lt;- as.factor(c(rep(1,100), rep(2,100), rep(3,100), rep(4,274))) ggplot(economics_epoch, aes(x=date,color=epoch))+ geom_line(aes(y=unemploy), size=10) So goofy. Compared to… ggplot(economics_epoch, aes(x=date,fill=epoch))+ geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=unemploy,ymin=unemploy-1000)) Also, it’s common to confuse “fill” and “color.” You can see the difference: ggplot(economics_epoch, aes(x=date,color=epoch))+ geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=unemploy,ymin=unemploy-1000)) And if you wanted to use both for different reasons because you’re a maniac ggplot(economics_epoch, aes(x=date,color=epoch, fill=rev(epoch)))+ geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=unemploy,ymin=unemploy-1000)) You can also assign single values to an aes, though as we’ll see, it’s usually better to do that in a scale. You can give colors using color names or RGB hex values passed outside the aes argument - remember the aes is a mapping from the data to the geom! Assigning a fill within the aes argument assumes you mean that your hex value is a level in a factor (and who could blame it), but assigning it outside the aes argument means that you are sending that color to the geom directly. ggplot(economics_epoch, aes(x=date))+ geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=unemploy,ymin=unemploy-1000), fill=&quot;#F0A125&quot;) ggplot will do its best to figure out how to split your data when combining multiple aesthetics, but here is one extra trick: Say you want to split your data by two factors but don’t want to make a new column in your dataframe or color them. You can use the interaction() function like (ignore the use of theme(), we’ll get to that): # we have two factors, cut and color, with the levels... levels(diamond_sub$cut) ## [1] &quot;Fair&quot; &quot;Good&quot; &quot;Very Good&quot; &quot;Premium&quot; &quot;Ideal&quot; levels(diamond_sub$color) ## [1] &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;J&quot; # and we want to make a plot with all their permutations: ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=interaction(cut,color)))+ geom_bar()+ theme( axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90) ) I’ll give ya a list of all the aesthetics by shapes once we know what a stat is. 6.3.3 Geoms &amp; Stats I’ve already thrown a lot of geoms your way, but there are a lot more where that came from. I’m not going to do a complete runthrough of all of them here because most of their use is relatively obvious once you know how to manipulate aesthetics, but if you’re hungry for it someone put together a nice graphical summary of the available geoms: This section is more concerned with the relationship between geoms and stats. Behind every great geom there’s a great stat. Stats act as intermediary functions between the incoming data and the geom - put another way, they relate the aes to the geom. Most common geoms just use the stat_identity that returns the number, but many can accept a stat=&quot;stat_as_string&quot; argument. Below is a table of geoms, their default stats, and their related aesthetic options (from page 57 of the ggplot book) A few examples of how to represent frequency data by manipulating stat: A classic histogram ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price))+ geom_histogram(color=&quot;white&quot;, bins = 20) This is equivalent to the call ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price))+ stat_bin(geom=&quot;bar&quot;, color=&quot;white&quot;, bins = 20) But calling it this way allows us to use whatever geom we’d like ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price))+ stat_bin(geom=&quot;step&quot;, color=&quot;blue&quot;, bins = 20)+ stat_bin(geom=&quot;point&quot;, color=&quot;red&quot;, bins = 20) If instead one wants the scale as a density, ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price))+ geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), color=&quot;white&quot;, bins = 20) Other stats can be accessed by calling another geom that uses it as their default. We can estimate a density kernel like: ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price))+ geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), color=&quot;white&quot;, bins = 20)+ geom_density() Yikes, our kernel is a little soft. We can adjust the bandwidth of the kernel (as its standard deviation)… ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price))+ geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), color=&quot;white&quot;, bins = 20)+ geom_density(bw=300) How about some two dimensional data? I need lines. thankfully we can directly perform linear models in ggplot. ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=table, y=depth))+ geom_point(alpha=0.2)+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, color=&quot;red&quot;, se=FALSE) And if you want your confidence intervals right there with ya too ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=depth, y=table))+ geom_point(alpha=0.2)+ geom_smooth(color=&quot;red&quot;, method=&quot;lm&quot;, level=0.99) We can also perform a few other smoothing/estimation operations, for example ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=table, y=depth))+ geom_point(alpha=0.2)+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;loess&quot;, color=&quot;red&quot;) And with a bit of convincing, ggplot will even do logistic regression for us ggplot(midwest, aes(x=percbelowpoverty, y=inmetro))+ geom_point(alpha=0.1)+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;glm&quot;, method.args=list(family=&quot;binomial&quot;), color=&quot;red&quot;) As we saw before, most geoms can be controlled directly by calling their related stat. When doing so, we can select which geom we’d like to plot our error bars with. ggplot(economics, aes(x=date, y=unemploy))+ geom_line(color=&quot;gray&quot;)+ stat_smooth(geom=&quot;linerange&quot;, size = 0.5, method=&quot;loess&quot;, level=0.99) How about some denser data. Remember our very first plot? There’s a whole lot more data that we randomly ignored. What if we weren’t some fraudulators and didn’t conveniently “lose our data?” ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price))+ geom_point(alpha=0.02) Wow that’s cool and smoky and all, but is it a good representation of the data?. If we summarize it with some hexagons … ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price))+ geom_hex(bins=50) ## Loading required package: methods Turns out it’s really easy to misrepresent your data if it’s not presented in a quantitatively meaningful way. Most of the density of our plot is in the lowest left section. Let’s try one more visualization method. Notice the ..density.. notation. Since density is a computed function, it is wrapped in a sorta weird half ellipse to make sure it doesn’t conflict with the dataframe in case it has a variable called density. ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price))+ scale_color_distiller(palette=&quot;Spectral&quot;)+ stat_density_2d(geom = &quot;point&quot;, aes(size = ..density.., color= ..density..), alpha=0.6, n=75, contour = F)+ theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill=&quot;#000000&quot;), panel.grid = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price))+ scale_color_distiller(palette=&quot;Spectral&quot;)+ stat_density_2d(geom = &quot;point&quot;, aes(size = ..density.., color= ..density.., alpha= ..density..), n=75, contour = F)+ theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill=&quot;#000000&quot;), panel.grid = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) 6.3.4 Position Is also important but I’m not covering it formally right now. ve most deel vis it. Until I do, if your bar charts aren’t looking right just monkey around on google with the phrase dodge ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price, fill=cut))+ geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price, fill=cut))+ geom_histogram(position=&quot;dodge&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. and maybe jitter ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=cut, y=price))+ geom_point() ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=cut, y=price))+ geom_point(position=position_jitter(width=0.25)) and maybe one more with fill ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price, fill=cut))+ geom_histogram(bins=50) ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price, fill=cut))+ geom_histogram(bins=50, position=&quot;fill&quot;) 6.3.5 Scales We have led our little geometric lambs to water, but what good is it if we don’t own the land? Every aesthetic component, including axes, is a scale. There are two types of scales, continuous and discrete. With scales, we control things like Color Breaks - if it’s an axis, where do we have ticks, if it’s a legend, what is marked in the legend? Labels - what do we call our breaks? Limits Expand - how much extra room we leave on the edges Transformations - log scales &amp; arbitrary transformations Position - If an axis, reposition top, bottom, left, or right depending on whether it’s an x or y axis. The general syntax to modify your scale is scale_aesthetic_continuous or scale_aesthetic_discrete, for example scale_x_continuous or scale_fill_discrete. For now, not going to spend much time on this because they are relatively self explanatory, but a few specific useful examples 6.3.5.1 Axis limits If you want to set axis limits manually, rather than allowing ggplot to figure them out for you… ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=table, y=depth))+ geom_point(alpha=0.8, position=position_jitter(width=.25))+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;loess&quot;, color=&quot;red&quot;)+ scale_x_continuous(limits=c(56, 60)) ## Warning: Removed 137 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth). ## Warning: Removed 204 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 6.3.5.2 Color Brewer If you don’t want to manually input colors and want to just follow best principles, color brewer is a godsend. Visit the color brewer website to see available color palettes. Or we can use a tool from RColorBrewer (to be covered in extensions): brewplot &lt;- RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all() To simply drop it in to any plot: ggplot(economics_epoch, aes(x=date,fill=epoch))+ geom_ribbon(aes(ymax=unemploy,ymin=unemploy-1000))+ scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Set1&quot;) And the continuous variant is called “Distiller” ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat,y=price,color=price))+ geom_point()+ scale_color_distiller(palette=&quot;RdPu&quot;)+ theme_dark() 6.3.5.3 Manual Colors To use your own colors, use scale_color_manual or scale_fill_manual (todo, trying to get some actually cool stuff in here) 6.3.6 Facets (Skipping detailed description for now… but) ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price))+ stat_density_2d(geom = &quot;point&quot;, aes(size = ..density.., color = ..density..), n=10, contour = F)+ scale_color_distiller(palette=&quot;RdPu&quot;)+ facet_grid(cut~color) 6.3.7 Coordinate Systems (skipping for now) 6.3.8 Themes The theme() command allows you fine control over each plot element. There are a few general types of plot elements: line rect text That are grouped by where they are used, for example in axis legend panel - individual plotting areas, for example each facet in a facet grid plot - the entire plotting area strip - titles on facets Settings are inherited hierarchically. For example, one can set the size of all text, the size of all axis titles, or just the x axis title. Reference to each is straightforward: text = element_text(), axis.title = element_text(), axis.title.x = element_text() ggplot comes with a few built-in themes: ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat,y=price,color=price))+ geom_point()+ theme_minimal() ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat,y=price,color=price))+ geom_point()+ theme_void() 6.3.8.1 Removing elements Sometimes you want to be all draped in pearls and roses, and other times you just need your black turtleneck. To remove items, replace them with a blank element: ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat,y=price,color=price))+ geom_point()+ theme( panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(), legend.position = &quot;none&quot; ) And sometimes you just want to make a mockery of your audience’s eyes like you’ve got your hands in the MS paint bucket again. Notice how since we are in a “g” rammar of “g” raphics (“plot”) (“2”) things work as we expect them to ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat,y=price))+ geom_point(color=&quot;pink&quot;)+ theme( panel.background= element_rect(fill=&quot;yellow&quot;), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(), legend.position = &quot;none&quot; ) A useful tool here is the direct specification of sizes with units. The general syntax for units are unit(number, “unit_type”), for example if you are trying to shout about how big those numbers are and dont understand what axis ticks are for ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat,y=price))+ geom_point()+ theme( panel.background= element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.text = element_text(size=unit(24,&quot;pt&quot;)), axis.ticks = element_line(arrow=arrow(type=&quot;closed&quot;)), axis.title = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(), legend.position = &quot;none&quot; ) Uh oh, who is screwing with our medicine? Our text is now hopelessly buried beneath our arrows. We can fix that by adjusting our margins. The margins are set in the order top, right, bottom, left. Since that doesn’t really make sense, they advise you to remember the phrase “trouble” and that actually works. Notice the inheritance. Even though we make settings for the x and y axis text specifically, it still retains our 24 point mistake. Margins can also be used with the plot.background to eliminate excess space, and can be set to negative numbers. ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=carat,y=price))+ geom_point()+ theme( panel.background= element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.text = element_text(size=unit(24,&quot;pt&quot;)), axis.text.x = element_text(margin= margin(20,0,0,0, unit=&quot;pt&quot;)), axis.text.y = element_text(margin= margin(0,20,0,0, unit=&quot;pt&quot;)), axis.ticks = element_line(arrow=arrow(type=&quot;closed&quot;)), axis.title = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(), legend.position = &quot;none&quot; ) 6.3.9 Extensions ggplot has lots of extensions. But we’ll leave it at that for now…. 6.4 Lattice lattice stuff here 6.5 Rendering Having plots in your R environment is one thing, but getting them out into the world or stuffed into your papers is quite another. Without explicitly specifying certain parameters like sizes and positions, your figure will end up with text crowded across the screen or nonevident without microscopy. It’s always a good idea to make those specifications explicit with the theme() function, but some things require that ggplot has knowledge about the rendering environment. 6.5.1 Using Graphics Engines bring over from Data chapter 6.5.2 ggsave What happens when we just try to export our figure window? # Scales lets us change the y axis numbers from scientific notation to decimal notation library(scales) g.price_density &lt;- ggplot(diamond_sub, aes(x=price, y=..density.., fill=cut))+ geom_density(position=&quot;stack&quot;)+ scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Set1&quot;, guide=guide_legend(title=&quot;Cut&quot;))+ scale_y_continuous(name=&quot;Density&quot;, labels=comma)+ scale_x_continuous(name=&quot;Price&quot;)+ theme_minimal()+ theme( panel.grid.major = element_blank(), legend.position = c(.8,.65) ) # Saving figure by clicking &quot;export&quot; from figure window Good god what have you done to the boy. Since the rendering is dependeng on the size of the plotting environment ggplot has rendered it into, our plot comes out looking very sad indeed. The basic tool for exporting ggplot figures is the function ggsave. It allows us to explicitly specify the size, resolution, rendering engine, etc. Ggplot has many saving “devices,” or rendering engines, the basic categories of which are raster engines (like png) - which convert your plot into a series of pixels and color values, and vector engines (like pdf or svg) that leave the plot as a set of logical instructions. You should preserve your plots as vectors as long as you possibly can, as they are lossless representations of the image, and allow you to edit it by element in another program. ggsave(&quot;price_density_plot.png&quot;, g.price_density, path=&quot;guide_files&quot;, # you can use relative or absolute paths device=&quot;png&quot;, width=unit(6,&quot;in&quot;), height=unit(4,&quot;in&quot;), dpi=300 ) Much better. 6.6 Grid Ok, we might know what a statistical plot is, but what is a ggplot? Ggplot follows the grid graphics model, which is a set of primitive graphical elements like circles, lines, rectangles, that have some notion of their position within a “viewport” (ggplot’s panels). GRaphical OBjects in grid are called “grobs,” and we can convert our plot to be able to directly manipulate its grobs. g.grob &lt;- ggplotGrob(g.price_density) Your plot’s layout information is in its layout, heights, and widths attributes. Each of the numbers in the layout matrix corresponds to a width (for the “t”(op), and “b”(ottom) columns), or height (for the “l” and “r”). Each grob has its outer extent specified by these values, so the background has its top at position 1, left at position 1, bottom at 10 and right at 7 - the largest values of each, predictably. By default, heights and widths of undeclared elements are “null” or “grobheight” units that depend on the size of the viewport. You can set them explicitly as you might expect with g.grob$heights[5] &lt;- unit(5,&quot;in&quot;) or whatever. This becomes critical for ensuring axes across multiple plots are the same size. The “children” or “grobs” of the main grob object contain each of the literal graphical objects, and they behave just like the parent. g.grob$layout ## t l b r z clip name ## 18 1 1 10 7 0 on background ## 1 5 3 5 3 5 off spacer ## 2 6 3 6 3 7 off axis-l ## 3 7 3 7 3 3 off spacer ## 4 5 4 5 4 6 off axis-t ## 5 6 4 6 4 1 on panel ## 6 7 4 7 4 9 off axis-b ## 7 5 5 5 5 4 off spacer ## 8 6 5 6 5 8 off axis-r ## 9 7 5 7 5 2 off spacer ## 10 4 4 4 4 10 off xlab-t ## 11 8 4 8 4 11 off xlab-b ## 12 6 2 6 2 12 off ylab-l ## 13 6 6 6 6 13 off ylab-r ## 14 6 4 6 4 14 off guide-box ## 15 3 4 3 4 15 off subtitle ## 16 2 4 2 4 16 off title ## 17 9 4 9 4 17 off caption g.grob$heights ## [1] 5.5pt 0cm ## [3] 0cm 0cm ## [5] 0cm 1null ## [7] sum(2.75pt, 1grobheight) 1grobheight ## [9] 0cm 5.5pt g.grob$widths ## [1] 5.5pt 1grobwidth sum(1grobwidth, 2.75pt) ## [4] 1null 0cm 0cm ## [7] 5.5pt g.grob$grobs ## [[1]] ## zeroGrob[plot.background..zeroGrob.2978] ## ## [[2]] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[3]] ## absoluteGrob[GRID.absoluteGrob.2951] ## ## [[4]] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[5]] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[6]] ## gTree[panel-1.gTree.2933] ## ## [[7]] ## absoluteGrob[GRID.absoluteGrob.2945] ## ## [[8]] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[9]] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[10]] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[11]] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[12]] ## titleGrob[axis.title.x..titleGrob.2936] ## ## [[13]] ## titleGrob[axis.title.y..titleGrob.2939] ## ## [[14]] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[15]] ## TableGrob (3 x 3) &quot;guide-box&quot;: 2 grobs ## z cells name ## 99_281d9cc4e523da50b6c36763eedff87c 1 (2-2,2-2) guides ## 0 (1-3,1-3) legend.box.background ## grob ## 99_281d9cc4e523da50b6c36763eedff87c gtable[layout] ## zeroGrob[NULL] ## ## [[16]] ## zeroGrob[plot.subtitle..zeroGrob.2976] ## ## [[17]] ## zeroGrob[plot.title..zeroGrob.2975] ## ## [[18]] ## zeroGrob[plot.caption..zeroGrob.2977] We can see that deep down at the core of our plot is just a bunch of polygons. I arrived at these numbers by just listing them recursively (calling g.grob$grobs, seeing which one I needed, etc.). We can directly edit the graphical properties of these polygons (gp) as you might expect. We then # We have to load the grid library to do some commands, might as well load it now library(grid) g.grob$grobs[[6]]$children[[3]]$children ## (polygon[geom_ribbon.polygon.2911], polygon[geom_ribbon.polygon.2913], polygon[geom_ribbon.polygon.2915], polygon[geom_ribbon.polygon.2917], polygon[geom_ribbon.polygon.2919]) g.grob$grobs[[6]]$children[[3]]$children[[1]]$gp$lwd &lt;- 10 g.grob$grobs[[6]]$children[[3]]$children[[1]]$gp$fill &lt;- &quot;#FF51FD&quot; g.grob$grobs[[6]]$children[[3]]$children[[1]]$gp$col &lt;- &quot;yellow&quot; # grid.newpage() clears the current viewport (so your plots don&#39;t just keep stacking up) # grid.draw() redraws our grob in the current viewport grid.newpage() grid.draw(g.grob) I have no idea why you keep wanting to do this to your plots.
